16-year-old Jaylen Brooks is having the worst day ever. First, she gets into a fight with her best friend, then she's expelled from school. As she's standing on the side of the road, trying to figure out what to do, she sees a man in a black SUV pull up next to her. He offers her a ride, and she gets in. The man, who introduces himself as Mr. Smith, takes her to a secluded cabin in the woods. He tells her that he's been watching her and that he knows she's special. He says he's going to help her unlock her true potential. Jaylen is initially skeptical, but Mr. Smith starts to show her things that she's never seen before. He teaches her how to control her emotions and how to use her mind to influence the world around her. Jaylen is amazed by what she's learning and starts to consider Mr. Smith as a father figure. Meanwhile, the authorities are searching for Jaylen. Her parents are frantic and the FBI is convinced that Mr. Smith is a dangerous cult leader. As the manhunt intensifies, Jaylen finds herself torn between the life she once knew and the new one that Mr. Smith is offering her. As Jaylen spends more time with Mr. Smith, she starts to doubt whether or not he's really looking out for her best interests. She starts to suspect that he's only interested in her because of her powers. One night, she has a vision of Mr. Smith harming someone. She's not sure if it's real or just her imagination, but she decides to confront him about it. Mr. Smith gets angry and admits that he has plans for Jaylen that go beyond just helping her develop her abilities. He tells her that he wants her to join him in his quest to take over the world. Jaylen is horrified and tries to run away, but Mr. Smith uses his powers to stop her. He convinces her that she's not safe anywhere else and that she needs to stay with him if she wants to stay alive. As Jaylen continues to live with Mr. Smith, she starts to lose touch with reality. She starts to believe that he's the only one who truly understands her. She becomes more and more isolated from the outside world and starts to doubt her own sanity. One day, Jaylen has a powerful vision of Mr. Smith leading a group of people in a mass suicide. She realizes that he's going to try to make her do the same thing. She decides she has to stop him before it's too late. Using everything she's learned, she finally breaks free of Mr. Smith's control. She races to the cult's compound, where she knows he's planning to carry out his plan. She arrives just in time to stop him. In a final showdown, she uses her powers to destroy the cult and save the people who were about to be killed. With Mr. Smith gone, Jaylen is finally free to live her own life.
