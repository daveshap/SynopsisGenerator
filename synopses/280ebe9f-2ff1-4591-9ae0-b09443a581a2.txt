AFTER hundreds of years of war, the world is finally at peace. But that peace is threatened when a new emperor, Constantine, rises to power in the West. Constantine is a ruthless ruler, and he has his sights set on conquering the East. To do that, he needs to control the city of Rome. But the people of Rome are depticting to follow orders, so Constantine calls in his best general, Flavius Aetius, to take the city by force. Rome is a city of great religious diversity, with people following or having backgrounds in a variety of religions. Constantine sees this as a threat to his rule, and he orders his troops to put an end to it. The people of Rome, led by the religious leaders of their respective faiths, band together to resist. But they are no match for the might of Constantine's army. The city falls, and Constantine orders all of the religions banned except for Christianity. The ban on all religions except Christianity leads to years of religious persecution in Rome. But the people of Rome continue to practice their faith in secret. They also continue to resist Constantine's rule, and they plot to overthrow him. Constantine, meanwhile, is faced with another problem: the barbarian tribes who have been attacking the empire's borders. He knows that he needs to stop them before they breach the city walls. But he is also determined to crush the resistance once and for all. He sends his troops to put down the rebellion, but the people of Rome are prepared this time. They fight back, and they are joined by the barbarian tribes. Together, they drive Constantine's army back. Constantine is defeated, and Rome is free once again. With Constantine gone, the people of Rome can practice their religions openly once again. The city is also safe from the barbarian tribes. But the peace is short-lived. Just a few years later, another emperor, Theodoric, rises to power in the West. He is just as ambitious as Constantine was, and he soon sets his sights on Rome. Theodoric knows that he needs to control the city in order to conquer the East. The people of Rome, led by their religious leaders, once again band together to resist. They are joined by the barbarian tribes, and together they drive Theodoric's army back. Theodoric is defeated, and Rome is free once again. The city of Rome has been through a lot, but its people have remained strong. They have fought for their freedom, and they have won.
