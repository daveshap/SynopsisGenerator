It is the Iron age in England. The land is divided into numerous warring tribes, and life is brutal and dangerous. One tribe, the Salisbury Plain tribe, is ruled by a tyrannical leader, who keeps his people in a state of terror. The tribe is living in squalor, with barely enough food to survive. One day, the leader decides to go on a raiding party to capture slaves and plunder other tribes. He orders his most trusted warrior, Cradoc, to lead the attack. Cradoc is a brave and fiercely loyal warrior, who has been with the leader since they were children. Cradoc does not want to raid other tribes and take slaves, but he knows that he must obey his leader's orders. He leads the raiders to a nearby village, where they capture several slaves and plunder the village. Cradoc is disturbed by the violence and brutality of the raid, but he does not say anything. Once they return to the Salisbury Plain tribe, the leader orders the slaves to be put to work immediately. Cradoc is sickened by the way the slaves are treated, but he does not say anything. He knows that if he does, he will be put to death. Cradoc continues to lead the raids on other villages, and he becomes increasingly disgusted with the violence and brutality. One day, he disobeyes a direct order from the leader and refuses to participate in a raid. The leader is furious and orders Cradoc to be put to death. Cradoc is brought before the tribe and is given a choice: he can either be put to death or he can be exiled from the tribe. Cradoc knows that if he is put to death, his wife and child will also be put to death. He decides to take the exile option. Cradoc says goodbye to his wife and child and sets out into the wilderness. He is not sure where he is going, but he knows he cannot stay with the Salisbury Plain tribe. He wanders for several days, until he comes across a small village. The villagers are friendly and welcoming, and they offer Cradoc a place to stay. Cradoc is shocked by the contrast between the Salisbury Plain tribe and the village. The village is clean and well-organized, and the people are happy and content. Cradoc begins to realize that the Salisbury Plain tribe is living in squalor and misery because of the leader's tyrannical rule. Cradoc decides to stay in the village and help the people. He uses his skills as a warrior to teach them how to defend themselves against raiders. He also helps them to build a strong palisade around the village. The village prospers and flourishes under Cradoc's leadership. The people are happy and content, and they live in peace and harmony. One day, the Salisbury Plain tribe comes to the village and demands that the people hand over Cradoc. The villagers refuse, and the Salisbury Plain tribe attacks the village. Cradoc leads the villagers in a fierce battle against the Salisbury Plain tribe. The Salisbury Plain tribe is eventually defeated and driven away.
