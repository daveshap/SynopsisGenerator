Life is never dull for Mediterranean teenager, Katerina. She's always getting into mischief with her friends, much to the chagrin of her conservative parents. But when Katerina's latest escapade goes too far, they decide it's time to send her away to boarding school in England. Katerina is appalled. She'll be miles away from her friends, and the Mediterranean lifestyle she loves so much. But what she doesn't realize is that boarding school will be the best thing to ever happen to her. At first, everything is terribly awkward. Katerina doesn't know how to act around her new classmates, who seem so stuffy and boring. But she soon realizes that there's more to them than meets the eye. They may not be as exciting as her friends back home, but they're still a lot of fun. Eventually, Katerina settles in and starts to enjoy herself. She makes new friends, and even starts to develop a crush on a boy in her class. But when her parents come to visit, she's in for a shock. They've decided to move back to the Mediterranean, and Katerina will have to leave her new life behind. Katerina is devastated. She doesn't want to leave her friends, or her new crush. But she knows she has to go. The day before she leaves, Katerina decides to make the most of her time. She spends the day with her friends, doing all the things she's going to miss. They go to the beach, eat ice cream, and just generally have a great time. That night, Katerina has a heart-to-heart with her best friend. They swear to stay in touch, and to never forget each other. The next day, Katerina says goodbye to everyone. It's hard, but she knows she'll see them again someday. Katerina is now settled back in the Mediterranean. She misses her friends, but she's glad to be home. She keeps in touch with them, and even visits England once in a while. As she gets older, Katerina looks back on her time at boarding school with fondness. It was a time of self-discovery, and she's thankful for the experience.
