Life in the future is not what anyone expected. The world is a broken, chaotic place, and the once-great civilization of Egypt is in ruins. into this setting steps our protagonist, a young woman named Sympathy. She's a bit of an outcast, not really fitting in anywhere. But she's got a good heart, and she's determined to make a difference in the world. One day, she comes across a strange artifact, a mirror that shows a different person in the reflection. Intrigued, she steps through the looking glass and finds herself in another world: a world that is the opposite of her own in every way. This is a world where Egypt is a powerful empire, and Sympathy is a princess. At first, Sympathy is thrilled to be in this wonderful place. But she soon discovers that appearances can be deceiving. This world is not as perfect as it seems. The emperor is a cruel, tyrannical ruler, and the people are oppressed and unhappy. Sympathy is horrified by what she sees and decides to do something about it. Rising up against the empire, Sympathy quickly becomes the leader of a rag-tag group of rebels. They fight against the emperor and his forces, using whatever means necessary. They are outnumbered and outgunned, but they're fighting for a cause they believe in. And Sympathy is a force to be reckoned with. The rebels quickly gain ground, winning victory after victory. But the emperor will not give up easily. He unleashes his deadliest weapon: a massive army of robots designed to crush the rebels. Outmatched and outmatched, the rebels seem to be doomed. But Sympathy has a plan. She leads the remaining rebels into the emperor's palace, where they confront him directly. In a spectacular final showdown, they defeat the emperor and his army, liberating the people of Egypt and bringing peace and freedom to the land at last. And so the world is saved, thanks to the courageous efforts of Sympathy and her band of rebels.
