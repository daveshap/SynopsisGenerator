In the early modern era, exploitation films were big business. They usually featured big city life, with action-packed scenes and pulse-pounding excitement. The characters were typically spirited, full of energy and vigor. The tone was usually upbeat, lighthearted, and optimistic. The style was often highly descriptive, with elaborate descriptions and expressive language. One particular exploitation film, "The Big City", was particularly popular. It told the story of a young woman who moves to the big city in search of adventure and excitement. She quickly finds herself in the middle of a crime wave, and is forced to use all her wits and resourcefulness to survive. The action is non-stop, and the pace intensifies as the story reaches its gripping conclusion.
