3,000 years ago, in a time long forgotten, the continent of Africa was a land of harsh conditions and dangerous beasts. The people who lived there were a hardy bunch, walking a tightrope between the dangers of the wild and the comforts of home. One such person was Khemet, a young man of the Anubi tribe. Like all Anubi, Khemet was a skilled hunter and tracker. He was also incredibly Sassy, with a quick wit and sharp tongue. One day, while out tracking a herd of gazelle, Khemet came across a strange sight: a large, imposing stone structure in the middle of the desert. Curious, he approached it, only to be met by a mystical being who called herself Tefnut. Tefnut told Khemet that he was chosen to be the new Pharaoh of Egypt, and that he would lead his people to a new land of plenty. Khemet was dubious, but Tefnut insisted, telling him that he was the only one who could free Egypt from the tyrannical rule of the god Set. Khemet agreed, and set off on a journey to gather the tribes of Egypt. Along the way, he picked up some unlikely companions, including a talking camel named Jorah and a sassy scorpion named Ahh-nubis. Finally, Khemet and his companions arrived at the pyramids of Giza, where they were met by the god Horus. Horus told Khemet that he must use the power of the pyramids to defeat Set and free Egypt. With the help of his friends, Khemet was able to harness the power of the pyramids and defeat Set. Egypt was free at last, and Khemet became its first Pharaoh. Khemet ruled Egypt for many years, and under his guidance, it flourished. The people were happy and prosperous, and Egypt became a land of plenty. As Khemet grew older, he began to think about his legacy. He wanted to make sure that Egypt would be prosperous long after he was gone. To that end, Khemet ordered the construction of the Great Sphinx, a massive stone statue that would stand as a symbol of Egyptâ€™s strength and resilience. And so Egypt prospered for centuries, until it was finally discovered by the outside world. But the legacy of Khemet and his friends lives on, in the stories and myths of a land that was once lost in time.
