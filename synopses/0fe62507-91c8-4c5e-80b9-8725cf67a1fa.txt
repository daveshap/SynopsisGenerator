In the deep underwater city of Atlantis, a young woman named Arietta is trying to keep her head above water. She's struggling to make ends meet, working multiple jobs and barely scraping by. But her world is turned upside down when she's kidnapped by a group of mysterious creatures called the Nix. The Nix take Arietta to their undersea kingdom, where she's held captive in a strange and sinister palace. There, she meets the Nix king, a man named Orin, who tells her that she has a very special talent. Arietta is a gifted singer, and Orin wants her to use her voice to help him control the minds of the humans of Atlantis. Arietta is horrified by Orin's plan, and she knows she needs to find a way to escape. But the more she learns about the Nix and their world, the more she realizes that there's much more at stake than just her own life. Orin is a dangerous and power-hungry ruler, and if Arietta can't stop him, he could destroy Atlantis and all of its inhabitants. Arietta spends months in captivity, trying to find a way to escape. But the Nix are always watching her, and she knows she can't make a move without them knowing about it. Even worse, the more time she spends with Orin, the more she realizes how evil he truly is. He's cold, calculating, and completely ruthless. One day, Arietta is taken to a dark and secret chamber in the palace, where she's shown a horrifying sight. Orin has been using his power to control the minds of the humans of Atlantis, and he's using them to do terrible things. He's made them kill and steal, and he's even had them commit suicide. Arietta is disgusted and terrified, and she knows she has to do something to stop Orin. Finally, Arietta comes up with a plan. She pretends to go along with Orin's wishes, and she starts singing for him. But secretly, she's using her voice to plant suggestions in his mind. She tells him to free the humans of Atlantis, and she suggests that he leave the underwater city and never come back. Orin doesn't know what to think, but he's slowly starting to believe Arietta's suggestions. He's beginning to question his own actions, and he's starting to see the humans of Atlantis as people, not just pawns to be used and manipulated. Arietta's plan is working, but then Orin discovers what she's been doing. He's furious, and he confines her to her chambers. Arietta knows she needs to find a way to escape, before Orin does something even more terrible. She develops a close bond with one of the Nix guards, a woman named Nereida, and she starts to share her plan with her. Nereida is hesitant at first, but she eventually agrees to help Arietta. Together, they make their escape from the palace and swim back to Atlantis. But Orin is close behind them, and he's not going to give up easily. He's determined to find Arietta and make her pay for betraying him. Arietta and Nereida make it back to Atlantis, but they're not safe yet. Orin is right behind them, and he's determined to find them. He's also determined to take control of Atlantis and rule it with an iron fist. Arietta and Nereida start to rally the people of Atlantis, and they begin to fight back against Orin. They know they can't let him win, and they're willing to risk everything to stop him. Orin is a powerful opponent, but Arietta and her allies are slowly winning. Finally, they confront Orin and defeat him. But at what cost? Atlantis is left in ruins, andArietta is left with the knowledge that she's responsible for the death of Orin and the destruction of her home.
