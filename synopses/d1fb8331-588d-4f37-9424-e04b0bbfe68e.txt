Kaitlyn finishes her final exams and looks forward to her summer break. She will be spending a month with her Aunt in Korea and is very excited to experience a different culture. Her Aunt picks her up from the airport and they drive to their home in the city. On the way, they pass by a beautiful mountain and Kaitlyn asks if they can go hiking there. Her Aunt says that it is too dangerous, as there are many wild animals in the area. Kaitlyn spends her first few days in Korea getting to know her Aunt and helping her with household chores. She is also introduced to the local customs and cuisine. One day, while her Aunt is at work, Kaitlyn decides to explore the city on her own. She gets lost and ends up in a shady part of town. She is accosted by a group of angry young men and only narrowly escapes. Kaitlyn is shaken by the incident and decides to stay close to home for the rest of her trip. One night, Kaitlyn is awakened by a noise outside her window. She looks out to see a large, furry creature climbing up the side of the building. The creature notices Kaitlyn and freezes. Kaitlyn is terrified and screams, alerting her Aunt and the rest of the building. The creature runs away and is never seen again. Despite the creature sighting, Kaitlyn enjoys the rest of her trip and is sad to say goodbye to her Aunt when the time comes. She promises to come back and visit soon.
