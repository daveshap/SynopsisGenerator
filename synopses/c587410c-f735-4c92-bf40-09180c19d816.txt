In the year 2200, North and South Korea have unified to form one country. But the peace is fragile, and when a old prophecy begins to circulate that a great warrior will rise up and reunite the country, tensions begin to mount. Into this volatile situation steps our heroine, a young woman named Ji-ha. Ji-ha is the daughter of a poor family in the countryside. But she is also blessed with extraordinary martial arts skills, which she has honed through years of hard work and training. When she learns of the prophecy, she believes that she is the one who is destined to fulfill it. So Ji-ha sets out on a journey to find the other half of the country that she has never seen. She has many adventures along the way, meeting new friends and enemies, and learning about the troubled history of her country. Finally, she arrives in the capital city, where she discovers that the prophecy was only half right. The true warrior who will unite the country is her own estranged twin sister, who has been living in the city all this time. The twin sisters must now fight side by side to defeat the forces of division that have tearing their country apart for centuries. But even if they are successful, they know that the country will never be truly united until the heart of each Korean learns to love and respect the other. The sisters triumph over their enemies and achieve a lasting peace for their country. But the real victory is in the bonds of love and understanding that have been formed between the two halves of the country. Ji-ha and her sister stand hand in hand, symbols of a new Korea that is whole and at peace at last.
