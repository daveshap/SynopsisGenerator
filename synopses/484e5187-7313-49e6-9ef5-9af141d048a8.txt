Life in Japan is quiet and uneventful until strange things start happening. The first is a series of UFO sightings. Then, people start disappearing. Soon, the country is in a state of panic. The government tries to downplay what's happening, but it's clear that something is very wrong. As the situation deteriorates, the military is called in to restore order. But even they are no match for the forces that are now attacking the country. As the situation spirals out of control, the people of Japan are forced to flee their homes. They head towards the one place that might be safe: the mountains. In the mountains, the refugees set up a camp. They do their best to survive, but conditions are tough. There is little food and shelter is scarce. And they are not the only ones in the mountains. The camp is soon joined by others who have also fled the violence in the city. Together, they try to figure out what is happening and how to stop it. But it's not long before they are attacked again. This time, though, they are prepared. They fight back and, against all odds, they win. But their victory is short-lived. The enemies return, stronger than ever. The battle rages on, but it's clear that the people of the camp are losing. Desperate, they make one last stand. And this time, they are successful. They defeat their enemies and drive them away. But the cost of victory is high. The camp is destroyed and many people are killed. Those who survive must now find a way to rebuild their lives. The survivors of the camp scatter. Some go back to the city, others head into the mountains. They all have one thing in common: they will never forget what happened. The events of that fateful summer have changed them forever. They have seen the worst of humanity. But they have also seen its capacity for good. And they will never give up hope that someday, peace will come to their country again.
