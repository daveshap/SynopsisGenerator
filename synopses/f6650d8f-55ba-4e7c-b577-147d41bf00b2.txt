Sgt. Pepper is a cat who works as a mechanic in the Pacific island of Guam. She's been in the business for years, and she's seen a lot of strange things come through her shop. But nothing has prepared her for the day when a group of anthropomorphic animals comes in, covered in blood and begging for help. The animals explain that they're part of a traveling circus that was attacked by a band of pirates. Most of the troupe was killed, but they managed to escape and make their way to Sgt. Pepper's shop. They need somewhere to hide until they can figure out what to do next. Sgt. Pepper agrees to help, and she opens up her shop to the animals. She starts to get to know them and quickly realizes that they're a clever and resourceful bunch. With their help, she comes up with a plan to take down the pirates and get revenge for her friends. Sgt. Pepper and the animals begin to put their plan into motion. They start by sabotaging the pirates' ship, making it difficult for them to sail. Then, they set a trap for the pirates on shore, leading them into a firefight with the local police. The pirates are soon outnumbered and outgunned. They retreat back to their ship, but Sgt. Pepper and the animals are waiting for them. They open fire on the ship, causing it to explode. The remaining pirates are arrested and taken away. Now that the danger has passed, Sgt. Pepper and the animals can finally relax. They share a few laughs and some tears as they say goodbye to their new friends. They all promise to keep in touch, and Sgt. Pepper looks forward to seeing what the future holds for her new friends. Sgt. Pepper and the animals go their separate ways, but they remain in touch. Sgt. Pepper continues to work in her shop, and the animals continue to tour with their circus. They send each other postcards and updates, and they always remember the adventure they shared.
