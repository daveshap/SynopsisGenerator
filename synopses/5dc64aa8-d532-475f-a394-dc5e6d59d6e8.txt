In the year 100 A.D., the human race has spread out across the galaxy, colonizing new worlds and developing new technologies. One of these technologies is cybernetics, which allow humans to augment their bodies with mechanical implants. The story follows two main characters, Jadeon and Rai, who are both cyborgs. Jadeon is a cyborg assassin who has just been hired to kill Rai, a political dissident who is wanted by the government. As Jadeon begins to stalk Rai, he starts to question his own motives and whether or not he really wants to kill Rai. At the same time, Rai is going about his everyday life, unaware of the danger that is closing in on him. As the two men's lives intersect, they will be forced to confront the choices that have led them to this point. Can they find a way to escape their pasts and forge a new future? Jadeon and Rai's paths continue to cross as Jadeon continues to shadow Rai. During this time, Jadeon starts to feel a growing sense of connection to Rai and begins to question whether or not he really wants to kill him. At the same time, Rai begins to suspect that he is being followed and starts to take precautions to protect himself. He also starts to investigate the person who has been hired to kill him and discovers that it is Jadeon. Rai contacts Jadeon and the two meet to talk. During their conversation, they realize that they have a lot in common and that they both want to find a way to escape their pasts. They make a pact to help each other and start working together to try to find a way out. End: Jadeon and Rai's efforts pay off and they are able to find a way to start new lives away from the violence and danger of their pasts. They settle on a remote planet and start a new life together. As they adjust to their new life, they must also deal with the lingering effects of their cybernetic implants. They must learn to control their new abilities and how to use them to protect themselves and their new home. Ultimately, they must learn to trust each other and themselves as they navigate this new world they have created.
