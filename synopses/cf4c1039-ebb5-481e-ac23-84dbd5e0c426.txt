A group of space explorers, including the hapless and unlucky John, find themselves orbiting a strange planet. They have no idea what they will find, but are soon drawn in by the strange noises and smells emanating from the surface. They land, and are immediately accosted by a hostile group of cannibals. The group is captured and taken prisoner. John and his fellow prisoners are subjected to a series of horrifying atrocities at the hands of the cannibals. They are tortured, mutilated, and forced to watch as the cannibals feast on the flesh of their comrades. As the days go by, John becomes more and more resentful and angry, until finally he snaps and kills one of his captors. This act of defiance galvanizes the other prisoners, and they stage a daring escape. The prisoners make a break for freedom, but are pursued by the cannibals. They are forced to fight for their lives, and in the end only a handful of them make it back to the safety of their ship. John is forever changed by his ordeal, and the events of those nightmare days will haunt him for the rest of his life.
