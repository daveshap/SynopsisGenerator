During the early modern period in China, crime was rampant and the justice system was struggling to keep up. In response, the government decides to establish a new criminal investigative unit, made up of the best and brightest minds in the country. One of the members of this unit is a young woman named Xin. She's smart, resourceful, and determined to make a difference. Xin and her team are tasked with solving some of the most complex and high-profile cases in the country. They quickly establish a reputation for being the best in the business. However, as the cases become more and more dangerous, Xin begins to wonder if she's really cut out for this line of work. She starts to doubt herself, and her resolve is tested like never before. Despite the challenges, Xin and her team continue to solve cases and put away criminals. But with each victory, the stakes seem to get higher and higher. one day, they're tasked with investigating a string of murders that seem to be connected to a powerful political figure. The closer they get to the truth, the more they realize that they're in over their heads. As they race against the clock to solve the case, they come up against roadblocks at every turn. Finally, they're forced to make a decision that could put their careers - and their lives - at risk. Despite the danger, Xin and her team refuse to give up. They eventually crack the case, but not before paying a heavy price. Xin is left scarred by the experience, but she's also more resolve than ever to make a difference. She and her team continue to work together, taking on the toughest cases that come their way. They knows that the work is never going to be easy, but they're determined to see justice served - no matter what the cost.
