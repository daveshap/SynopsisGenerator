They are able to find a small island to land on and they set up a base camp. From there, they begin to explore the planet. They soon realize that the planet is inhabited by a race of aquatic creatures. The creatures are friendly and curious, but they are also very different from the group. The group must learn to communicate with the creatures if they want to find a way to coexist. Meanwhile, the enemy has finally tracked them down to the new planet. The group must fight for their survival once again. The group is successful in repelling the enemy and they are able to establish a truce. They are finally able to live in peace and begin to build a new life on the planet. The planet is a beautiful and hospitable world, and the group is able to thrive.
