On the planet Suvell, a group of mercenaries are hired by a local lord to help him defend his territory against a neighboring lord who is proving to be a nuisance. The mercenaries are a ragtag group, but they're the best that the lord can afford. The group consists of a snarky human captain, a large and surly orc, a uses-too-many-words elven mage, and a silent and deadly half-elf ranger. They're not the most reliable group, but they're all the lord has. The mercenaries begin their journey, making their way through the lord's territory. They're constantly on the lookout for the enemy, but they never find him. This makes the captain increasingly angry, and the rest of the group starts to get on edge as well. Then, one night, they're finally ambushed. The enemy has been lying in wait for them, and they attack with a ferocity that takes the mercenaries by surprise. The captain is killed in the first few moments of the fight, and the rest of the group is quickly overwhelmed. The enemy lord triumphantly stands over their bodies, victorious. The lord's victory is short-lived, however, as the survivors of the group wake up and begin to fight back. The elven mage uses his magic to decimate the enemy's ranks, and the half-elf ranger picks them off one by one with her deadly accuracy. The orc is the only one who doesn't seem to be doing much damage, but he's holding the enemy lord at bay long enough for the others to take him down. Eventually, the enemy lord is killed and the mercenaries win the day. They return to the lord's castle, battered and bruised but alive. The mercenaries are celebrated as heroes, and the lord rewards them generously for their efforts. They go their separate ways, but they all know that they'll always have a bond with each other. They're a family now, even if they're not related by blood.
