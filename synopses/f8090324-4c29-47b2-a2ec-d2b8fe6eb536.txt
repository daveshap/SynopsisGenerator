In the small town of Harrisonville, Ohio, the residents are struggling to get by. The economy has tanked and jobs are scarce. The town's only source of income is the coal mine, but the mine is on the verge of closing. In desperation, the town's mayor turns to a group of Chinese businessmen who have expressed interest in opening a factory in the town. The mayor is hoping that the factory will provide much-needed jobs for the town's residents. The Chinese businessmen agree to open the factory, but only if the town's residents are willing to work for very low wages. The town's residents have no choice but to agree. The factory opens and the town's residents begin working long hours for very little pay. The working conditions are harsh and the hours are long, but the town's residents are just happy to have jobs. Life is difficult, but the town's residents are determined to make the best of it. They work hard and try to provide for their families as best they can. The town's residents are also determined to hold onto their jobs, even when the Chinese businessmen begin to cut corners and cut back on benefits. The town's residents know that if they lose their jobs, they'll have nothing. The town's residents continue to work at the factory, even when conditions become increasingly dangerous. Finally, one day, there is a terrible accident at the factory. Several workers are killed and many more are injured. The town's residents are finally fed up. They demand better working conditions and better pay, but the Chinese businessmen refuse to budge. The town's residents know that they need to take a stand. They go on strike, refusing to work until their demands are met. After a lengthy and difficult battle, the town's residents finally win their fight. They receive better pay and better working conditions. The factory is also forced to make some much-needed safety improvements. The town's residents have finally won a victory, but they know that the fight is far from over. They will continue to fight for their rights and for a better life for their families.
