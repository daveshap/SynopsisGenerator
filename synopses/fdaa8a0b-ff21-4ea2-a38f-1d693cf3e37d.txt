It's the late 18th century in the Pacific. Europeans have been colonizing the area for centuries, but they're not the only ones here. There are also native Pacific Islanders, some of whom have supernatural abilities. One of these is Mau, who has the ability to see the future. He's also the son of the village chief. One day, Mau is out fishing when he sees a strange creature in the water. He doesn't know what it is, but he knows it's going to be trouble. He tries to warn his village, but no one will listen to him. Soon, the creature, which is a giant octopus, attacks the village. Mau's father is killed and Mau is the only one who knows how to stop the creature. Mau sets out on a journey to find the octopus and stop it. He's joined by some of his village's elders, as well as a European missionary, Father Gregory. They have many adventures along the way, and Mau gradually comes to understand more about his own abilities and the ways of the European colonists. eventually, they reach the octopus's lair and Mau is able to defeat it. In the process, he learns that the octopus was controlled by a witch who was using it to get revenge on Mau's village. With the octopus gone, Mau is able to return to his village and begin rebuilding. Mau is now a respected leader in his village, and he's also gained a greater understanding of the ways of the Europeans. He's no longer the same na√Øve boy he was when he set out on his journey, and he's ready to face whatever challenges come his way.
