It is the late 19th century and man has just began to walk on the moon. Our story begins with a young man, John, who is an aspiring astronomer. He has just built himself a telescope and is spending his evenings studying the stars. One night, while John is peering through his telescope, he sees something strange on the moon. He can't quite make out what it is, but it looks like a person or something. John is intrigued and decides to build a rocket ship to go to the moon to investigate. After several months of hard work, John's rocket ship is finally complete. He climbed aboard and blasted off into space. After a few days of travel, he finally arrived on the moon. He disembarked from his ship and began to explore. He soon found the object he had seen through his telescope. It was a person! But not just any person, it was a beautiful woman. She was unconscious and appeared to be in some sort of distress. John knew he had to help her. He took the woman back to his rocket ship and nursed her back to health. Once she was feeling better, she told John her story. She said her name was Alice and she was from a wealthy family back on Earth. She had been kidnapped by a group of outlaws and was being held for ransom. But before they could ransom her, she escaped and made her way to the moon in a stolen rocket ship. But unfortunately, her ship was damaged in the escape and she was stranded on the moon. John felt terrible for Alice and decided he would help her get back to Earth. But getting back to Earth wasn't going to be easy. The outlaws were still after Alice and were hot on their trail. John and Alice had to travel across the face of the moon, evading the outlaws, while making repairs to the rocket ship. It was a long and arduous journey, but finally they made it back to Earth. John and Alice parted ways, but they remained friends and would often write to each other and share stories of their adventures.
