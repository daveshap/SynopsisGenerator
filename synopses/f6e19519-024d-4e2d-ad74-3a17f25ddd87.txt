In an alternate history, the Mediterranean region is a bustling center of trade and culture in the 18th century. Kingdoms and empires vie for control of the region, and the cities are crowded, cosmopolitan places. In this world, there are three major powers: the Ottoman Empire, the Republic of Venice, and the Holy Roman Empire. The Holy Roman Emperor is aigious and has a strong interest in the occult. He is also obsessed with finding proof of the existence of other intelligent life in the universe. To this end, he funds an expedition to a small island off the coast of Tunisia. The island is supposedly the home of a creature known as a "djinn". The djinn is reputed to be a powerful being that can grant wishes. The expedition is led by a Venetian adventurer, Marco Polo. Polo is a skilled navigator and an experienced traveler. He is also fluent in a number of languages, including Arabic. The expedition arrives on the island and begins to search for the djinn. They soon realize that the island is inhabited by a race of intelligent creatures known as the D'jkara. The D'jkara are a peaceful people who have been living on the island for many centuries. The D'jkara tell Polo and his men that the djinn is a myth. They say that the only way to leave the island is to find the magical "Lotus Flower". The D'jkara agree to help the expedition find the Lotus Flower. After a long and arduous journey, the expedition finally finds the Lotus Flower. However, the Holy Roman Emperor's men are not content to simply go home. They want to take the D'jkara back to Europe so that they can be studied and exploited. Polo and his men are horrified by this plan. They know that the D'jkara will not survive in captivity. They also know that the Emperor will never believe that they are intelligent beings. Polo and his men decides to help the D'jkara escape. They build a large ship and load it with food and supplies. The D'jkara are reluctant to leave their homeland, but they know that it is the only way to save themselves. The ship sets sail for an unknown destination. Polo and his men hope to find a place where the D'jkara can live in peace and freedom. The ship arrives on the island of Malta. The D'jkara are initially excited to be in a new place. However, they soon realize that the Maltese are a hostile people. The Maltese do not want the D'jkara on their island and they make it clear that they are not welcome. Polo and his men decide to leave Malta and continue their journey. They soon arrive on the island of Sicily. The Sicilians are more welcoming than the Maltese, but they are still not interested in the D'jkara. The D'jkara are getting homesick and they long for their homeland. Polo and his men know that they cannot go back to the island of Tunisia. The Emperor's men are probably still there, waiting to capture them. The expedition decides to go to the island of Sardinia. However, when they arrive, they find that the island is already inhabited by a race of intelligent creatures called the N'mbu. The N'mbu are a warlike people who are constantly at war with each other. The N'mbu are not interested in the D'jkara and they quickly drive them away. The expedition is forced to leave Sardinia and they have no idea where to go next. They eventually decide to go to the island of Corsica. Corsica is a beautiful island and the D'jkara are finally able to settle down and make a home. However, the peace is short-lived. The Corsicans are soon at war with the Genoese. The Genoese are a powerful maritime nation and they quickly overwhelm the Corsicans. The D'jkara are once again forced to flee. This time, they go to the island of Sicily. The Sicilians are still not interested in the D'jkara, but they are not actively hostile. The D'jkara are able to live in peace on Sicily for many years. They build a thriving community and they are finally able to put down roots. However, the peace is shattered when the Sicilians go to war with the Carthaginians.
