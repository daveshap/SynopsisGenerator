In the North Atlantic, off the coast of present-day Canada, a storm is raging. A small ship is caught in the storm and is tossed about by the waves. The crew is desperately trying to keep the ship from foundering. Suddenly, a large wave strikes the ship and it begins to sink. The crew is able to make it into two small lifeboats. One of the lifeboats contains the captain, the ship's doctor, a gay couple, and a transgender woman. The other lifeboat contains the first mate, a lesbian couple, an intersex person, and an asexual man. The two lifeboats are separated in the storm and each group is washed up on a different island. The island that the captain and his group are stranded on is inhabited by a hostile tribe of Native Americans. The other island is inhabited by a group of men who have turned to cannibalism in order to survive. The two groups are unaware of each other's existence and each must struggle to survive on their own. The captain's group is constantly harassed by the Native Americans. The gay couple is killed and the transgender woman is raped. The doctor is the only one who is able to reason with the Native Americans and he is able to get them to stop attacking the group. The group is finally able to build a boat and they sail away. The other group is slowly picked off one by one by the cannibals. The intersex person is the first to be killed and eaten. The asexual man is the next to be killed. The lesbian couple is the last to be killed. The cannibals are about to kill and eat the first mate when she is rescued by the captain's group. ENDING: The ship's captain and the first mate are the only ones who survive. They are rescued by a passing ship and eventually make their way back to civilization. The experience has been heartwrenching for both of them and they are changed forever.
