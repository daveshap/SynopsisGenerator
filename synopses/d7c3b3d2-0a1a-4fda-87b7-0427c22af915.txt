In the year 946 AD, Norway is in the midst of a fierce winter. In the small village of R rowing a single Viking longship breaks through the ice. On board is a young man named Erik, who has left his home in search of adventure. Erik and his crew soon find themselves in the land of the snowy giants - a strange and dangerous place where men are said to turn into animals, and where the dead can come back to life. As Erik and his men explore this new land, they quickly realize that the stories are true. They encounter a troll, a giant, and a creature that can control the weather. But the most dangerous thing they find is the dragon, who Erik must face if he ever wants to see his home again. Erik is no stranger to danger, but the dragon is more than he bargained for. The fight is long and fierce, but eventually Erik emerges victorious. With the dragon dead, Erik and his men are able to explore the rest of the land and find its treasures. Erik also finds the love of his life, a beautiful giantess named Freya. However, the peace is short-lived. The dragon's death has unleashed an ancient evil that had been trapped in the ground. This evil is a creature known as the Fenrir, and it is determined to destroy everything in its path. Erik and his men are the only ones who can stop the Fenrir, but they are outnumbered and outgunned. With the help of Freya and the other giants, they make a final stand against the creature. In a spectacular battle, they finally defeat the Fenrir and save the world from destruction. Erik and his men return home to Norway, victorious but weary from their long fight. Erik is now a hero, and he and Freya live happily ever after. The land of the giants is now at peace, and the people can live in safety and prosperity.
