It is the 3rd century BCE and a group of travellers are setting out on a long journey across France. They are a mixed group, made up of both men and women of various ages. Among them is a brooding woman who is haunted by her past mistakes. The group is travelling in search of answers to the mysteries of the world. They are hoping to find enlightenment in the ancient ruins and temples of France. The journey is not an easy one. They face many challenges along the way, including bandits, hostile locals, and treacherous mountain passes. But they persevere, pushed onwards by their shared sense of purpose. During their travels, they learn more about each other and themselves. The brooding woman begins to open up about her past and her fears. The group forms strong bonds of friendship and trust. They also grow closer to each other physically, as the mild sensuality of the journey begins to take its toll. At long last, they reach their destination: a ruined temple in the heart of France. There, they finally find the answers they were looking for. But the cost of these answers is high, and the group is forever changed by what they have experienced.
