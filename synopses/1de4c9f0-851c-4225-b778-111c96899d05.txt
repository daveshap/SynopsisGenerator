The story begins with the protagonist, a young woman of color living in a big city, noticing strange things happening around her. She starts seeing strange people and creatures that no one else seems to be able to see. She also begins hearing voices that no one else can hear. These voices tell her to do things that she wouldn't normally do and lead her on a path to discover the truth about what's happening to her. In the beginning, the protagonist is confused and scared by the strange things happening to her. She doesn't know who to trust or what to believe. She starts out relatively passive, but as she gets deeper into the mystery, she becomes more active and determined to figure out what's going on. Along the way, she makes allies and enemies with the different people and creatures she encounters. As the story progresses, the protagonist slowly starts to piece together what's going on. She discovers that she has the ability to see and communicate with spirits. She also learns that the city she lives in is actually a portal to another world, a world that is controlled by powerful beings who use humans as pawns in their games. The protagonist discovers that she is not the only one with these abilities. There are others like her who are able to see and communicate with spirits. Together, they form a group to try to figure out what's going on and to stop the powerful beings from using the city as a portal. They have many adventures and close calls as they try to stop the beings from entering our world. In the end, the group is successful in stopping the powerful beings from using the city as a portal. The protagonist and her allies are able to close the portal and prevent the beings from coming through. They all go their separate ways, but the experience has changed them forever. They all now know that there is more to the world than what meets the eye and that there are otherworldly forces at work.
