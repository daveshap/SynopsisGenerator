In the year 1 BCE, a young woman named Selene is living in North Africa with her father, who is a Roman official. Selene is beautiful and has many admirers, but she is also headstrong and independent. One day, she meets a young man named Juba, who is of Berber descent. Juba is exotic and handsome, and Selene is immediately drawn to him. Despite her father's misgivings, Selene begins a relationship with Juba. They meet secretly, as her father would never approve of the match. Selene is happy with Juba, and she feels alive and free when she is with him. Eventually, Selene's father discovers the relationship and forbids her from seeing Juba again. Selene is heartbroken, but she knows that she must obey her father. She decides to run away with Juba, and they begin a new life together in the desert. Selene and Juba are happy together, but life in the desert is not easy. They must constantly move to avoid detection by Selene's father, who is now desperately searching for them. As their situation becomes more and more desperate, Selene begins to doubt whether she made the right decision in running away with Juba. She starts to miss her old life of luxury and comfort. Juba is patient and understanding, but Selene knows that he is also feeling the strain. One day, they are finally caught by Selene's father. He is furious, and he demands that Selene return home with him. She refuses, and Juba backs her up. Selene's father disowns her and leaves them to their fate in the desert. Selene and Juba are now completely alone in the desert. They must find a way to survive on their own, without Selene's father's help. They eventually find a small oasis, and they decide to make it their home. They start a new life there, and Selene finally feels at peace. She knows that she made the right decision in choosing Juba, and that she would never be happy living the life her father wanted for her.
