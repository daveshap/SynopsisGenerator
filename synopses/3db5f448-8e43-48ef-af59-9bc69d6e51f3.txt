In a small village in New Zealand, life is relatively mundane and uneventful. But when a strange new family moves into the old farmhouse on the outskirts of town, strange things begin to happen. The family doesn't seem to age, they always wear dark clothing, and they never seem to come out during the daytime. The village children are naturally curious about this family, and one day they decide to explore the farmhouse. They find a strange room with a big mirror in it, and when they look into the mirror they see themselves in a different time period. They also see a group of people wearing strange clothing and carrying weapons. The children realize that they have accidentally stepped into a time warp and are now in the middle of a battle. They are quickly surrounded by the enemy, who recognizes them as villagers and demands to know where the rest of the villagers are. The children are terrified and have no idea what to say. They eventually blurt out that the villagers are all hiding in the forest. The enemy doesn't believe them, but decides to search the forest anyway. The children take advantage of the distraction to run back to the village and warn the others. The villagers start to flee into the forest, but the enemy soon catches up to them. A bloodbath ensues, and soon the entire village is exterminated. A few days after the massacre, a small group of survivors including the original group of children who discovered the time warp, meet up in the forest. They are traumatized and disillusioned, but they refuse to give up. The group decides to try and find a way back to their own time period. They know that the time warp must still be open somewhere, and they believe that if they can find it they can reverse the massacre. The group starts to search the farmhouse, but the enemy is always one step ahead of them. They find the room with the mirror, but the mirror is now broken. They also find a hidden door that leads to a labyrinth of tunnels. The group spends months searching the tunnels, but they can't find a way out. They are finally cornered by the enemy, and they realize that they are going to die. But just as the enemy is about to kill them, the group is suddenly transported back to their own time period. They find themselves in the room with the mirror, and they realize that the time warp has been closed. The group is relieved and grateful to be alive, but they are also heartbroken over the loss of their village. They know that they can never go back, but they take comfort in the fact that they are the only ones who know what happened. The group of survivors eventually settles down in the village and builds a new life for themselves. They never forget what happened, but they find a way to move on. The village becomes a thriving community once again, and the children who discovered the time warp grow up and have children of their own. And as the years go by, the villagers forget about the massacre and the time warp that caused it. But one day, a group of strangers arrives in the village, asking questions about the time warp. The villagers don't know what to say, and they're not sure if they should tell the truth. But eventually, they realize that the time warp must be opened again. They know that it's the only way to prevent the massacre from happening again. And so the villagers lead the strangers to the farmhouse, and they show them the way to the hidden door.
