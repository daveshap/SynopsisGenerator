In space, on a small cooking station, a crew of unruly, under-trained cooks are trying to figure out how to make a meal that will meets the nutritional requirements of the space-travelers they are responsible for feeding. The head cook, an unlikeable woman named Griselda, is a gruff taskmaster who expects her crew to work long hours with little rest and meager meals. The cooks are constantly trying to find ways to make their food more palatable, or at least more appealing to look at. One day, a new cook arrives on the station. She is a small, delicate-looking woman with an ethereal quality about her. The other cooks are immediately dismissive of her, thinking that she will be unable to hack it in the tough conditions of the space station. The new cook, who is unnamed, quickly proves them wrong. She has a natural talent for cooking, and she is able to create meals that are both nutritionally sound and visually appealing. She also has a soothing way about her that calms the often chaotic atmosphere of the kitchen. As the new cook settles into her role on the station, the other cooks start to realize that there is more to her than meets the eye. She is mysterious and enigmatic, and they can't help but be drawn to her. One day, the new cook is preparing a meal for the crew, and she uses an unusual spice that she found growing on a nearby planet. The spice is so potent that it knocks the entire crew out for hours. When they wake up, they find that the new cook has disappeared. In her place is a large, dragon-like creature that is devouring their food. The crew is horrified and tries to kill the creature, but it is too strong and they are forced to flee the kitchen. The creature, which the crew has christened "the drudge", continues to live on the station, eating the food and destroying the kitchen. The crew is forced to ration their food and start eating unhealthy, unappetizing meals. The drudge becomes a symbol of the crew's failure, and they start to blame each other for their difficult situation. The tensions on the station boil over, and eventually the drudge is killed. With the drudge gone, the crew is able to return to their normal routines. But the experience has changed them, and they are all more mindful of the fragility of their situation. The story ends with the crew working together to create a meal that is both nutritionally sound and visually appealing, using the lessons they learned from the drudge.
