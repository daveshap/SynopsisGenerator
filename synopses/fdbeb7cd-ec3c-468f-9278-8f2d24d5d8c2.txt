In the isolated, rural village of Rocksville, New Zealand, strange and dark things have been happening for years. People have gone missing, animals have been mutilated, and there have been strange lights and sounds coming from the nearby forest. The villagers live in fear and none dare venture into the forest, except for the bravest or most foolhardy of souls. One night, a young woman named Sarah is walking home from the market when she sees a strange light in the forest. against her better judgment, she decides to investigate and goes into the woods. She finds a small clearing where there is a circle of strange symbols drawn in the dirt. In the center of the circle is a stone pedestal with a black book on it. Sarah is drawn to the book and opens it, against her better judgment. Inside the book, Sarah finds a detailed account of all the strange happenings in the village, going back for generations. The book is filled with dark and disturbing illustrations, depicting people being mutilated and sacrificed. Sarah is horrified by what she sees and tries to close the book, but it's like the book has a will of its own and she can't manage to do so. While she's looking at the book, Sarah hears a noise behind her and turns around to see a huge, furry creature standing in the clearing. The creature opens its mouth and lets out a blood-curdling scream, and then attacks Sarah. Sarah manages to fend off the creature and runs back to the village in terror. She tells the villagers what she saw and shows them the book, but they don't believe her. They think she's just been reading too many horror stories and tell her to stop making things up. Sarah is convinced that the creature is real and that it's somehow connected to the book. She decides to venture into the forest again, this time taking the book with her. She believes that if she can find the source of the creature, she can stop it from attacking the villagers. Sarah spends weeks in the forest, following the creature's trail. She has many close calls and comes face-to-face with the creature several times, but she always manages to escape. Finally, she comes to a small cabin deep in the forest. She knows this is where the creature is hiding and she's determined to find out what's going on. Sarah enters the cabin and finds a small room filled with candles. In the center of the room is a stone altar with a black book on it. The book is open and Sarah can see that it's filled with dark and disturbing illustrations, depicting people being mutilated and sacrificed. She's about to close the book when the door to the room slams shut and the creature appears. Sarah tries to run, but the creature is too fast and it catches her. She's paralyzed with fear and can only watch as the creature approaches her. The creature opens its mouth and lets out a blood-curdling scream, and then attacks Sarah. Sarah tries to fight back, but she's no match for the creature. It seems like the end for her, but then she hears a voice in her head telling her to use the book. Sarah manages to reach the book and uses all her strength to slam it shut. The book emits a bright light and the creature is sucked inside. The book slams shut and disappears, leaving Sarah behind. The village is safe now, but Sarah is forever changed by her experience. She can never forget what she saw in the book and she knows that the creature is still out there somewhere.
