Sachiko is a young woman in 17th century Japan who has been forced into an arranged marriage with a man she does not love. She is quietly resigning herself to her fate when she meets Jiro, a charming, handsome and eligible young man who seems to be interested in her. Sachiko begins to falls for Jiro, but her mother tells her that he is beneath their station and she must marry the man she has been betrothed to. Sachiko's mother arranges for her to meet with Jiro one last time before her wedding to say goodbye, but Sachiko instead tells him that she loves him and wants to run away with him. Jiro is hesitant, as he knows her family would never approve, but Sachiko is adamant and they elope. Sachiko and Jiro are forced to live in hiding, as her family is searching for them. They move from place to place, always one step ahead of Sachiko's family. They are happy together, but the constant stress of being on the run takes a toll on their relationship. Jiro begins to doubt whether they can make a life together, but Sachiko is more determined than ever to find a way to make it work. Sachiko's family finally catches up to them and her father demands that she return home. Jiro is ready to give up and let her go, but Sachiko refuses to go back and she tells her family that she would rather die than return to a life she does not want. Sachiko's father disowns her and she is left with nothing. Jiro takes her in and they continue to live in hiding, but Sachiko is now a shadow of her former self. Her spirit is broken and she has lost all hope. One day, Sachiko's family comes to find her and they offer her a choice: she can either come home and marry the man they have chosen for her, or she can remain with Jiro and live the life of a fugitive. Sachiko chooses Jiro and they leave together. They start a new life, far away from her family, and they are finally happy.
