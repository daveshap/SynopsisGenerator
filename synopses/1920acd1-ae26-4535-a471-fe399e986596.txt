In early modern Japan, a young girl named Ame wanders into the forest of riddles. There she meets a strange creature who asks her a riddle. If Ame can answer correctly, she will be allowed to leave the forest. But if she gets the riddle wrong, she will be stuck there forever. Ame correctly answers the creature's riddle and is allowed to leave the forest. However, she is now followed by the creature, who continues to ask her riddles. Ame quickly realizes that the only way to get rid of the creature is to answer every riddle correctly. Ame's life becomes consumed by riddles as the creature continues to follow her everywhere, asking her new riddles every day. Ame becomes so good at riddles that she attracts the attention of the Emperor of Japan. He asks her to come to the palace and solve a riddle for him. Ame correctly solves the Emperor's riddle and he is so impressed that he makes her his official Riddle Master. Ame is now responsible for creating riddles for the Emperor and his court. She lives a happy life until one day, the creature from the forest reappears and asks her one final riddle. Ame correctly answers the creature's riddle, but instead of disappering, the creature transforms into a human. He explains that he is a riddle-lover who was cursed to live in the form of a creature unless he could find someone who could solve all his riddles. Ame is the first person to ever accomplish this. The Emperor is so impressed by Ame's riddle-solving skills that he makes her his queen. Ame and her riddle-loving husband live happily ever after, solving riddles together for the rest of their days.
