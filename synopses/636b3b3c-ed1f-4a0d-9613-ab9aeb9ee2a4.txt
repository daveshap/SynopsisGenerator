In an alternative timeline, the middle east is a peaceful place ruled by a sultan. One day, a young woman named Sheikha arrives in the sultan's palace. She is beautiful, and the sultan is immediately attracted to her. The sultan begins to court Sheikha, and she eventually becomes his wife. However, she is a cold and unemotional woman. The sultan is frustrated by her lack of passion, but he is determined to win her over. One night, the sultan takes Sheikha to a private garden where he proceeds to make love to her. She is unresponsive at first, but eventually she begins to respond to his touch. The sultan is overjoyed, and they spend the night making love. In the morning, the sultan and Sheikha are found in the garden by the sultan's advisors. They are both naked, and it is clear that they have been making love. The sultan's advisors are shocked and appalled, but the sultan is unapologetic. He tells them that Sheikha is his wife and that he loves her.
