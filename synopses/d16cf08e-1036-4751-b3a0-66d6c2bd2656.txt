A long time ago in another solar system, there was a time of legend. This was a time when powerful beings ruled over the people and great heroes roamed the land. One of these heroes was a man named Daren. Daren was strong and brave, and he had a heart for justice. He fought for the people against the tyrannical rulers, and he won many victorys. One day, Daren was confronted by a being of immense power. This being was called the Watcher, and he told Daren that he had been chosen to become the protector of the people. The Watcher gave Daren a sword and a shield, and he told him that he would need them in the days to come. Daren did not know what to make of the Watcher's words, but he knew that he had to do something. He gathered together a group of brave heroes, and they set out to fight against the tyrannical rulers. They had many adventures and they won many victories, but the road was long and hard. One day, Daren and his companions came to a village that was being oppressed by a cruel ruler. Daren knew that he had to do something to help the people, so he challenged the ruler to a duel. Daren fought with all his strength, but the ruler was too powerful and he defeated Daren. As Daren lay dying, the people of the village begged him to stay and help them, but Daren knew that he had to continue his journey. Daren's journey took him to many different places, and he met many different people. He fought against evil wherever he found it, and he slowly began to gain a reputation as a great hero. One day, Daren received a vision from the Watcher. The Watcher told him that the time had come for him to challenge the greatest evil that had ever existed. Daren knew that he had to face this evil, but he was scared.He gathered together his friends and they set out on a quest to find the evil. They travelled to a dark land, and there they found a castle that was surrounded by a dark force. They knew that this was the evil they were looking for, and they prepared to face it. Daren and his companions fought bravely, but the evil was too powerful and they were defeated. As Daren lay dying, he saw the Watcher standing over him. The Watcher told him that he had done everything that was asked of him, and that he was proud of him. Daren asked the Watcher to watch over the people, and then he died. The Watcher took Daren's body and laid it to rest in a secret place. He then took Daren's sword and shield and gave them to a young man who was just beginning his journey. The Watcher told the man that he was the new protector of the people, and that he would have to take up the fight against evil. The new protector steps up and leads the fight against evil, carrying on the legacy of Daren. The people look to him for hope and courage, and he gives them both. He is a strong and brave leader, and he will not rest until evil is defeated.
