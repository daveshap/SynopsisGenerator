The novel begins on Mars, in the year 20xx. The planet has been colonized by humans for over 100 years, and whilst there is still some tension and conflict between the various nations on Earth, for the most part Mars is a peaceful and thriving place. The story follows police detective John Carter, who is investigating a series of murders that have been taking place across the planet. All of the victims have been high-ranking officials from different nations, and Carter quickly realizes that the killings are part of a larger conspiracy. Carter's investigation eventually leads him to the mastermind behind the murders: a woman named Helen Webber, who is seeking to start a new world order with herself at the helm. Webber is an immensely powerful and dangerous woman, and Carter knows that he must stop her before she can achieve her objectives. The middle of the story sees Carter and his team working tirelessly to track down Webber and stop her. They are constantly one step behind her, however, and as the body count continues to rise, Carter becomes increasingly desperate. He faces many challenges and setbacks along the way, but eventually he and his team are able to zero in on Webber's location. The climax of the story sees Carter and his team engaging in a final showdown with Webber and her henchmen. It is a fierce and brutal battle, but in the end Carter is victorious. With Webber dead and her conspiracies exposed, peace and stability are finally restored to Mars. Carter is left a hero, and he is hailed as the man who saved Mars. He retires from active detective work, but remains involved with the police force in an advisory capacity. He remains on Mars for the rest of his life, and eventually dies in his sleep at the age of 90. He is mourned by the many people whose lives he touched, and his memory lives on as one of the greatest heroes in Mars' history.
