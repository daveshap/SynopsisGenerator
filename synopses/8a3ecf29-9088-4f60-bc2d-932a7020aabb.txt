In a small village in Africa, life is hard but peaceful. The people are poor but content. One day, a strange man arrives in the village. He is different from anyone they have ever seen before and they are immediately suspicious of him. The man, who calls himself Juju, begins to perform strange rituals and ceremonies. He claims to be able to commune with the spirits of the dead and says that he has been sent to help the village. The villagers are initially scared of Juju but, over time, they begin to see that he is actually helping them. He helps them to resolve disputes, finds lost animals, and even heals the sick. Gradually, the villagers start to believe in Juju and his powers. They start to see him as a kind of shaman who can help them with their problems. However, there are some in the village who are still suspicious of Juju. They think that he is just a charlatan who is trying to take advantage of them. One night, Juju is performing a ritual to summon the spirit of a dead village elder. Suddenly, the elder's spirit appears and starts to speak through Juju. The elder tells the villagers that their ancestors are angry with them. He says that they have been neglecting their traditions and have been doing things that are disrespectful to the spirits. The elder goes on to say that the village is in danger. He says that there is a great evil coming and that only Juju can protect them. The villagers are terrified by what the elder has said. They start to worry that Juju may actually be possessed by evil spirits. Juju, meanwhile, is becoming increasingly erratic and violent. He starts to believe that he is the only one who can save the village from the evil that is coming. The villagers start to fear for their lives and they begin to wonder if Juju is actually possessed by evil spirits. One night, Juju goes into a trance and starts to summon forth evil spirits. The spirits possess the villagers and they start to act like animals. The village is in chaos and Juju is leading the charge. He is convinced that he is doing the right thing and that the village needs to be destroyed in order to save it. The villagers, possessed by the spirits, start to kill themselves and each other. There is bloodshed everywhere. In the midst of the chaos, the village elder's spirit appears to Juju. The elder tells Juju that he has been tricked by the evil spirits and that he is not really possessed by them. The elder tells Juju that he must stop what he is doing before it is too late. Juju comes to his senses and realizes that he has been deceived. He tries to stop the villagers from harming themselves but it is too late. The damage has been done and the village is destroyed. Juju is the only survivor and he is left completely alone. He is haunted by the memory of the village and the people who were killed. He knows that he can never forgive himself for what he has done.
