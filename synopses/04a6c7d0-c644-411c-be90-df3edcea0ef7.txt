One day, while climbing a tree, Isabella spots a strange object in the distance. She climbs down and runs to tell her friends, who all agree to follow her to see what she has found. As they approach the object, they see that it is a large iron door set into the side of a hill. They try to open it, but it is locked. Isabella's friends want to go back to the village and tell the adults, but Isabella is determined to find a way inside. She spends the next few days trying to find a key to the door, but she is unsuccessful. Finally, she decides to ask her father if he knows anything about the door. He tells her that it is part of an ancient temple that was built by the first people who lived in the area. He warning her to stay away from it, but Isabella is not deterred.

In the center of the room is a statue of a snake god. Isabella is mesmerized by the statue and she doesn't hear the sound of someone coming up behind her. She is startled when she feels a hand on her shoulder and she screams. It is her father. He has been looking for her and he is relieved to find her safe. He tells her that she is not allowed to come back to the temple, but Isabella is determined to find out more about the snake god.
