In a small town rural setting in the early Medieval era, a group of culturally diverse characters including those from racial and ethnic minorities and from non-white cultural groups are faced with a series of mystical events which challenge their beliefs and force them to examine the spiritual side of life. As the story progresses, the characters are forced to deal with more and more threats, both from within and from outside their community. They must grapple with their own biases and preconceptions, and learn to work together in order to survive. Throughout the story, the characters experience a wide range of emotions, from fear and sadness to hope and joy. They face difficult choices and must overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. But in the end, they triumph against all odds and emerge stronger and more tolerant than before.
