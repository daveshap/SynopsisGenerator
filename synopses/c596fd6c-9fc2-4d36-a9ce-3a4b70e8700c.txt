In 19th century Egypt, a group of British archaeologists are excavating an ancient tomb when they accidentally unleash a powerful curse. A malevolent presence begins stalking and preying upon them, picking them off one by one in bloody and gruesome ways. As the body count rises, the remaining survivors realize that they're up against something much more sinister and dangerous than they ever could have imagined. As the curse claims more and more victims, the tension and terror mounts. The survivors are beset on all sides by the ever-growing menace, and they frantically search for a way to escape the tomb before it's too late. In the midst of all the horror, they find themselves drawn to each other in a desperate need for companionship and comfort. But even if they do manage to make it out alive, they may be forever changed by the experience. Ultimately, only a handful of the archaeologists survive the ordeal. They emerged traumatized and changed, unable to forget the terror they experienced. They carry the physical and psychological scars of what happened to them, and the memory of their friends and colleagues who didn't make it out alive. The experience will haunt them forever.
