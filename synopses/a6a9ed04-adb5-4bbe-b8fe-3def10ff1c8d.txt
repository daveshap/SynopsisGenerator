In the 16th century, on another planet, a young woman named Lilith is born. She is different from everyone else, and she is ostracized because of it. When she is five, her parents are killed by a group of men who are looking for her. She is taken in by a woman named Mrs. Estephe, who tells her that she is special and that she has a great destiny. When she is sixteen, she is visited by a man who tells her that she must come with him to save the world from a great evil. She agrees, and she is taken to a training ground where she meets other people like her. They begin to train together, and Lilith quickly realizes that she is the strongest and most powerful of them all. As they continue to train, the group of friends grows closer. Lilith begins to fall in love with one of the men, but she knows that she can't act on her feelings because they have a greater purpose. The night before they are set to leave on their mission, Lilith is visited by Mrs. Estephe, who tells her that she must be the one to kill the evil leader. Lilith is reluctant, but she knows that it is her destiny. The group sets out on their journey, and they are quickly met with danger. They are ambushed by the enemy, and many of them are killed. Lilith is the only one who is left standing, and she knows that she has to find the leader and kill him. She finally confronts him, and she kills him. With the evil leader dead, the world is saved. Lilith returns to the training ground, where she is reunited with her friends. They all rejoice, knowing that they have saved the world. Lilith still carries the weight of all the lives that were lost, but she knows that their sacrifice was not in vain. She returns to her home planet, where she lives out the rest of her days in peace.
