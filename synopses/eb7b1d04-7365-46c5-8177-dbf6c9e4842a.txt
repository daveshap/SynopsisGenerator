Aadam, a 14-year-old boy living on Mars in the 14th century, is a thief and a scoundrel. He ekes out a living by stealing whatever he can and selling it to the highest bidder. One day, while Aadam is stealing a pair of boots from a marketplace stall, he is apprehended by the stall owner. The man demands that Aadam compensate him for the cost of the boots, but Aadam has no money. The stall owner threatens to turn Aadam over to the authorities, but Aadam begs for leniency. The stall owner agrees to let Aadam go if he will perform a dangerous task for him: stealing a priceless artifact from the palace of the ruling Khan. Aadam sets about planning the heist, enlisting the help of his friends and accomplices. They case the palace and devise a clever plan to get past the guards and into the Khan's treasure vault. On the night of the robbery, everything goes according to plan and Aadam makes off with the treasure. But as he and his cohorts are making their escape, they are ambushed by the palace guard. A fierce battle ensues, during which several of Aadam's friends are killed. Aadam himself is gravely wounded, but he finally manages to make it back to the market stall owner with the treasure. The stall owner is elated to have the treasure, but Aadam's injuries are severe. He is taken to a local healer, who does her best to save him. However, Aadam's injuries are too great and he dies a few days later. As he lies on his deathbed, Aadam reflects on his life of crime and regrets the choices he has made. He hopes that his friends and accomplices will be able to make a better life for themselves.
