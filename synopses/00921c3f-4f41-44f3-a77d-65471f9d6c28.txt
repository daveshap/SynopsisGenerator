The story opens with a young woman, our protagonist, in a dank and dark cell in a Scandinavian kingdom in the 3rd century BCE. She is awaiting her execution for a crime she didn't commit, and reflecting on her life up to this point. Flashbacks reveal that our protagonist, Leta, was born into a humble family and grew up in poverty. She was constantly teased and mocked by her richer peers, and she learned to fight and defend herself at a young age. When she was sixteen, she met a handsome young man named Erik, who was from a wealthy family. He was different from the other boys she knew, and he treated her with respect and kindness. They fell in love and started a secret affair, knowing that his family would never approve of her. Leta was happy for the first time in her life, and she dreamed of a future with Erik. But then Erik's father found out about their relationship and had Leta arrested and imprisoned for prostitution. Erik was heartbroken and swore to his father that he would never see her again. Leta was devastated, but she refused to give up hope that Erik would one day rescue her. Time passed, and Leta remained in prison, her hope slowly fading. She was becoming resigned to her fate, and she had almost given up hope of ever seeing Erik again when one day, out of the blue, he showed up at her cell. He told her that he had been working tirelessly to free her, and that he had finally managed to get her sentence reduced to life in prison. He plans to visit her as often as he can, and he promises to find a way to get her out of there eventually. Leta is elated and filled with hope once again. She vowed to stay strong and wait for Erik to come for her. The years passed, and Erik remained true to his word. He visited Leta often, and he eventually managed to get her released from prison. They were finally able to start a life together, and they lived happily ever after.
