Things come to a head when our protagonist is arrested and thrown into prison. While there, he meets a girl who has also been wronged by the emperor. Together, they plot their escape. After a daring jailbreak, they flee to the mountains, where they start gathering together a band of rebels. As word of their rebellion spreads, more and more people join their cause. Eventually, they have a huge army at their backs, and they march on the emperorâ€™s palace. In a spectacular battle, they overthrow the emperor and establish a new, more just regime. Our heroes settle down and live happily ever after, their names remembered fondly by history.
