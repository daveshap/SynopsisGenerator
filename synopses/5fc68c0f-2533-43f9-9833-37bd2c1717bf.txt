In a strange twist of fate, a young woman named Sarah Jane Smith finds herself with superpowers. She had always been an average person, but after a freak accident she discovers she has the ability to fly, shoot fire from her hands, and is incredibly strong. She decides to use her new abilities to help people and starts fighting crime in her home country of New Zealand. Sarah Jane quickly becomes a local hero, but she soon discovers that her powers attract the attention of others with abilities like her own. She meets a man called the Doctor, who tells her that she is part of a group of people with extraordinary abilities who are destined to save the world from a great evil. The Doctor takes Sarah Jane on as his apprentice and together they travel the world, fighting evil wherever it arises. Sarah Jane and the Doctor have many adventures together, and she soon becomes a powerful ally in the fight against evil. However, the Doctor is eventually killed in battle, leaving Sarah Jane alone to face the evil that he had been warning her about. The evil turns out to be a group of aliens called the Daleks, who have been planning to invade Earth for centuries. Sarah Jane rallies the other superheroes and leads the fight against the Daleks, ultimately defeating them and saving the world. With the Daleks defeated, Sarah Jane retires from her life as a superhero and settles down. She marries the Doctor's former companion, becomes a mother, and lives a happy and normal life. However, she always knows that she can return to her superhero life if the need ever arises again.
