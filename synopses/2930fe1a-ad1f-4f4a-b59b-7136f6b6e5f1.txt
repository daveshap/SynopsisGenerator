The earth was a blue-green dot in the distance, barely visible through the haze. But on this day, something was different. Something was stirring on the surface of the moon. A small figure was crawling out of one of the craters, shaking the dust off of its robes. As the figure stood up, it became clear that it was a man, though his features were strange and otherworldly. He had bright green eyes and long, silver hair that flowed down his back. He wore a flowing robe of blue and silver, embroidered with stars. The man stretched out his hand and spoke in a commanding voice. "I am Lunaris, Lord of the Moon. I have come to claim what is rightfully mine!" The earth shook and the moon began to grow larger in the sky. The man laughed maniacally as he grew taller and more powerful. protagonist's plans start to come together/reveal themselves, complications and obstacles arise Lunaris was not content with simply ruling the moon.

He knew that the earth's armies would be no match for his own. But as Lunaris's plans began to come together, he began to realize that there was one person who could stop him: the mysterious Moon Maiden. The Moon Maiden was a legend among the lunatics. She was said to be a powerful witch who lived on the dark side of the moon. It was said that she could control the tides and the weather.
