It is the year 2nd century BCE. The Roman Empire is at the height of its power and influence. Across the planet, people are living in different cultures and societies, each with its own customs and beliefs. One day, a great shock comes to the world. A massive object appears in the sky, orbiting the planet. It is so large that it can be seen from anywhere on the planet. The object is identified as a spacecraft of some kind. It is soon determined that the spacecraft is of extraterrestrial origin. This news sends shockwaves across the planet. Leaders of all the different cultures and societies begin to wonder what this means for their respective people. Some believe that this is a sign of a new age, while others believe that it could be a threat. As the days go by, it becomes apparent that the spacecraft is not going to leave. People all over the planet begin to panic. There is no telling what the aliens aboard the spacecraft might do. As the people of the planet anxiously await the next move of the aliens, a group of brave individuals decides to take action. They build a spaceship of their own and launch it into orbit. Aboard the ship are representatives of all the different cultures and societies of the planet. The goal of the mission is to make contact with the aliens and to find out their intentions. However, things do not go as planned. The aliens do not respond to the signals that the ship is sending. The ship is forced to land on the alien spacecraft. Once aboard the alien spacecraft, the representatives quickly realize that they are not alone. There are other human beings on the ship, people who were taken from their homes by the aliens. These people have been living on the ship for generations. As the representatives explore the ship, they come to learn that the aliens are not the only ones aboard. There are also other creatures, some of which are hostile. The representatives must find a way to escape the ship and get back to their own people. The representatives eventually find a way off the alien spacecraft. They return to their own people with the knowledge that there are other human beings out there, living on other planets. This experience changes the way people all over the planet think about their place in the universe. No longer are they alone. They are now part of a larger community.
