In a time long ago, before even the first humans set foot on the shores of New Zealand, the land was inhabited by a race of magical beings. These beings were of all shapes and sizes and had the ability to control the elements. One day, however, this peace was shattered when a group of beings known as the Dark Ones arrived from another world, bent on conquest. The Dark Ones were powerful and ruthless, and quickly gained the upper hand in the war. The magical beings knew they could not defeat the Dark Ones alone and reached out to the humans who had recently arrived in New Zealand. The humans were skeptical at first but after seeing the power of the Dark Ones, they agreed to help. Together, they fought back against the Dark Ones and after a long and bloody battle, they were finally able to drive them back to their own world. In the aftermath of the war, the magical beings and the humans formed a strong bond and decided to work together to protect the land. Many years passed and the land flourished. However, one day the Dark Ones returned, more powerful than ever. The humans and the magical beings fought back with everything they had but they were outnumbered and outclassed. Just when all hope seemed lost, a group of humans and magical beings discovered a powerful artifact created by the first humans. With this artifact, they were finally able to push back the Dark Ones and after a long and brutal battle, they were able to send them back to their own world. In the aftermath of the war, the magical beings and the humans formed an even stronger bond and decided to work together to protect the land. Many years have passed since then but the Dark Ones have not given up. They are always searching for a way to return and the humans and the magical beings must be always on their guard, ready to fight back.
