The story begins in the year 2450, in the Pacific region. The world is in the midst of the Middle Renaissance, and technology has advanced to the point where Pacific nations are some of the most powerful and influential in the world. In the midst of this, we follow the lives of two young people: Jack and Jill. Jack is a brilliant mind, but he's been dealt a tough hand in life. He comes from a poor family and has never had the opportunity to develop his talents. He's always been a little troublemaker, but he's never been able to catch a break. Jill is the daughter of a wealthy family, but she's never been given anything that she truly wants. She's always had to live up to her family's expectations, and she's never been able to be her true self. The two meet by chance one day and quickly become friends. They confide in each other and quickly develop a strong bond. They learn that they share a lot in common, and they start to dream about a better life for themselves. However, their friendship is quickly put to the test when Jack's family is forced to move away. They say goodbye, promising to keep in touch, but their lives quickly take different paths. Jill's family's wealth put her on a fast track to a successful life. She was groomed to be a powerful and influential Pacific leader. She excelled in her studies and quickly rose through the ranks. Meanwhile, Jack was struggling to make ends meet. He took odd jobs to try to support his family, but they always seemed to be one step ahead of homelessness. He became increasingly frustrated with the hand that life had dealt him. The two friends stay in touch via email and social media, but their lives increasingly diverge. Jill lives a life of luxury and privilege, while Jack scraping by just to get by. One day, out of the blue, Jack sends Jill a proposal: he's going to build a powerful computer that can hack into any government or corporate database. He needs her help to finance it, and in return, she'll get a cut of the profits. Jill is initially hesitant, but she's curious about the project. She decides to take a chance and invest in it. The computer is a success, and Jack and Jill quickly become rich. They set up their own company and start to live the life they always dreamed of. However, as their company grows, so do the dangers. They find themselves up against ruthless competitors, and they quickly learn that they're not the only ones with access to the computer's power.
