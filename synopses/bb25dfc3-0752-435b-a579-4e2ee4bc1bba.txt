In the small town of Puducherry, India, a young woman named Maya is struggling to make ends meet. She takes care of her sick mother and works odd jobs to support them both. One night, she met a woman named Lakshmi who told her about a village that was looking for a teacher. Lakshmi said that the village, called Kottakuppam, was a place where people from all over the world came to learn about India's rich culture and history. Maya was intrigued and decided to apply for the job. When she arrived in Kottakuppam, she was amazed by the diversity of the people there. She met people from all walks of life, including a woman named Sita who taught her about the traditional Hindu religion. She also met a man named Ravi, who was a professor at the local university. Ravi told her about the conflict between the British and the French colonial powers in India. Maya was fascinated by the history of the country and the people she met. As she got to know the people of Kottakuppam, she began to realize that there was a dark secret lurking beneath the surface. she learned that the village was built on top of an ancient temple that was believed to be cursed. The temple was said to be home to a demon that would bring death and destruction to anyone who entered it. Maya was skeptical of the story at first, but she soon realized that there was something sinister going on in the village. One night, she was walking home from work when she saw a group of men carrying a body into the temple. She was about to go for help when she heard someone calling her name. It was Ravi. He told her that she needed to leave the village immediately. He said that the men she saw were part of a cult that was planning to sacrifice her to the demon in the temple. Ravi managed to get Maya out of the village, but the cult members were hot on their heels. They were eventually caught and brought back to Kottakuppam. Maya was horrified to learn that the cult members were planning to sacrifice her mother to the demon in the temple. Maya was determined to save her mother and stop the cult from carrying out their evil plans. She enlisted the help of her friends Sita and Ravi. Together, they hatched a plan to infiltrates the temple and rescue Maya's mother. The plan was risky, but it worked. Maya and her friends were able to rescue her mother and stop the cult from sacrificing her to the demon. However, the leader of the cult, a man named Shankar, was not happy. He vowed to get revenge on Maya and her friends. Shankar began to spread rumors about Maya and her friends, saying that they were evil sorcerers who had released the demon from the temple. He also began to spread rumors about the village, saying that it was cursed and that anyone who stayed there would be cursed as well. As the rumors spread, more and more people began to leave the village. Maya and her friends were determined to stop Shankar from destroying the village. They came up with a plan to lure him into the temple and trap him there. Maya pretended to be possessed by the demon and lured Shankar into the temple. Once he was inside, they locked the doors and set the temple on fire. Shankar was killed in the fire and the village was safe. However, the damage was done. The rumors about the village had spread and it was now deserted. Maya and her friends were the only ones left. Maya and her friends decided to stay in the village and rebuild it. They worked hard to restore the village to its former glory. Slowly but surely, people began to come back to the village. The village was once again thriving. However, the demon that was trapped in the temple was not happy. It was angry and frustrated at being trapped. It wanted to be free. One night, Maya was awoken by a noise coming from the temple. She went to investigate and saw the demon trying to break out of the temple. The demon saw Maya and began to chase her. Maya ran for her life and managed to escape. She went to warn her friends and they decided to leave the village. They knew that the demon would never stop chasing them and they didn't want to risk the safety of the village. As they were leaving, Maya looked back at the village. She knew that she would never forget the village or the people she met there.
