The year is late Renaissance, and in orbit around a remote planet are two spacecraft. One is a small research vessel, piloted by a brave and courageous crew of scientists and researchers. The other is a massive warship, manned by a ruthless and tyrannical captain and his evil, sadistic crew. The research vessel has been studying the planet below for months, and has made a startling discovery. The planet is home to a valuable mineral that could be used to create a powerful new energy source. However, the research vessel is low on fuel and supplies, and the captain of the warship is determined to seize the mineral for himself. As the research vessel prepares to land on the planet, the warship moves in to attack. The courageous crew of the research vessel fights bravely against the overwhelming force of the warship, but they are outnumbered and outgunned. Just as the warship is about to destroy the research vessel, the captain of the research vessel makes a daring decision. He orders his crew to abandon ship, and then he crashes the research vessel into the warship, sacrificing himself to save his crew. The surviving crew of the research vessel are captured by the evil captain of the warship and taken prisoner. The captain plans to torture and interrogate the crew to find out the location of the valuable mineral on the planet below. However, the crew of the research vessel is made of brave and courageous people, and they refuse to give in to the captain's interrogation. The captain grows frustrated and angrier with each passing day, until finally he decides to execute the entire crew. The crew is lined up in front of a firing squad, and the captain gives the order to fire. However, just as the guns are about to go off, there is a sudden explosion. The warship is destroyed, and the crew of the research vessel is saved. It turns out that the captain of the research vessel had set the ship's self-destruct system before he crashed it into the warship. The explosion destroyed the warship and killed the evil captain and his entire crew. The surviving crew of the research vessel is rescued by a passing starship. They return to their home planet, where they are hailed as heroes. The mineral they discovered is used to create a new energy source that changes the world, and the crew of the research vessel is remembered for their courage and sacrifice.
