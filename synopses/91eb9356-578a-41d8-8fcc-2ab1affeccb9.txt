But despite his antics, the people of Daiping love Jia. One day, when Jia is out playing near the river, he finds a small, shiny object. He doesn't know what it is, but he takes it home with him. Later that night, Jia shows the object to his best friend,Li. Li is a curious boy and he is immediately fascinated by the object. He asks Jia where he found it.

They search around for the object but they can't find it. They do find a few more objects however, and they take these back to the village to show the other villagers. The villagers are excited by the objects and they ask Jia and Li where they found them. Jia and Li tell them about the river. The villagers are fascinated by the river and they decide to explore it. They find many more objects and they begin to build a boat to travel down the river. As the boat is being built, Jia and Li explore the river further and they find an entrance to a cave.
