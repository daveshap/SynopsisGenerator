In a small town in New Zealand, a young girl named Lilliana lives with her mother and father. Her mother is a kind and loving woman, but her father is strict and often tells Lilliana that she is not good enough. When Lilliana is ten years old, her mother dies suddenly from a sickness. This sends her into a deep depression, and she stops speaking entirely. Her father tries to get her help from a healer, but nothing seems to work. Lilliana's father decides to remarry, hoping that a new wife will be able to help Lilliana. He marries a woman named Elvira, who is much younger than him. Lilliana does not like Elvira and is resentful of her. One day, Lilliana's father invites a group of nobles to visit their home. Among them is a duke named Erick. Lilliana is immediately drawn to him and they begin talking. They hit it off immediately and it is clear that there is a strong connection between them. Erick asks Lilliana to go for a walk with him and she agrees. They walk and talk, and Lilliana finally feels like she can open up to someone. She tells him about her mother's death and how much she misses her. Erick listens and is very understanding. He tells her that he also lost his mother when he was younger and knows how she feels. After their walk, Erick asks Lilliana if she would like to go riding with him the next day. She eagerly agrees and they make plans. The next day, Lilliana goes riding with Erick. They have a great time and Lilliana feels herself opening up to him even more. They soon develop strong feelings for each other. Lilliana's father finds out about their relationship and is angered. He tells Erick that he is not good enough for his daughter and forbids them from seeing each other again. Lilliana is heartbroken, but she knows that she must obey her father. Erick leaves her with a letter, promising to come back for her one day. Lilliana tries to move on with her life, but she can't forget about Erick. She often thinks about the day when he will come back for her. Meanwhile, Erick is forced to marry another woman by his father. They have a child together, but Erick is still in love with Lilliana. He often thinks about her and wonders what could have been. Lilliana's father dies unexpectedly. She is now the Lady of the manor and must marry someone of nobility in order to keep her status. Lilliana agrees to marry a man named Alfred, but she does not love him. A few months before her wedding, Lilliana receives a letter from Erick. He tells her that he is coming back for her and asks her to meet him. She agrees and they make plans to meet. Lilliana is thrilled that Erick is coming back for her, but she is also nervous about what will happen. She knows that she must choose between him and her duty to marry Alfred. Erick arrives on the day that he and Lilliana are supposed to meet. However, he is intercepted by Lilliana's betrothed, Alfred. Alfred challenges Erick to a duel, which Erick wins. However, he is seriously injured in the process. Lilliana rushes to Erick's side. She tells him that she loves him and has always loved him. They share a kiss and they know that they will be together forever. Alfred is furious that Lilliana has chosen Erick over him. He vows to get revenge on both of them. Alfred begins to plot against Erick and Lilliana. He hires a group of bandits to attack them, but they are able to fight them off. Alfred then hires someone to poison Erick, but the plan fails and Erick does not become sick. Alfred's final plan is to set fire to Erick and Lilliana's home. He does so, but they are able to escape. Alfred is arrested and brought to trial. He is found guilty and sentenced to death. Erick and Lilliana are finally able to be together and they live happily ever after.
