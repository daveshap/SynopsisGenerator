At the age of 18, Clara is presented to society and becomes a debutante. She attends lavish balls and parties, but none of the suitors catch her eye. She remains single for several years, much to her parents' disappointment. Finally, when she is 23, Clara meets a young man named Roberto at a party and they instantly hit it off.
