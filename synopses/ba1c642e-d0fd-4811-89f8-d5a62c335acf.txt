In a far-off galaxy, a young boy named Jomo lives on a planet that is always under the rule of summer. One day, while out exploring with his friends, they come across a strange object that they have never seen before. Jomo is curious and decides to touch it, not knowing that it is a portal to another world. He is instantly transported to a planet that is the complete opposite of his own, where winter is forever present. This new world is called Earth. JOMO'S JOURNEY: Jomo soon realizes that he is not the only one who has been pulled into this world through the portal. There are other children like him, all from different planets, who are now stuck on Earth. Jomo befriends a girl named Lina, who is from a planet called Klendathu. Together, they try to find a way back to their own worlds. While they are exploring, they come across a group of people who are living in a settlement. They are the first humans Jomo and Lina have ever seen. The people in the settlement are scared of the two children and try to capture them. Jomo and Lina are able to escape, but they are now on the run from the humans. They continue to try to find a way back to their own worlds, but the longer they are on Earth, the more they realize that they may never be able to return home. They find a group of other children like them who have also given up on trying to go home. They join the group and start to build a new life on Earth. Jomo and Lina grow up and have children of their own. They live out their lives on Earth, never forgetting the worlds they came from but making the best of their new home. Jomo and Lina's story is just one of many that came to be because of the portal. There are countless other children from different worlds who have also been pulled into Earth. The portal has become a symbol of hope for those who are lost and alone. It is a reminder that there are other worlds out there, and that someday they may be able to find their way back home.
