The story begins underwater, in the Bronze Age. A group of divers is exploring a sunken city when they come across a strange artifact. It is a human-sized coffin, and inside of it is a perfectly preserved body. The divers are shocked to see that the body is wearing a diving suit and oxygen tanks, and that there is a still-working lantern inside the coffin. They realize that this must be the body of a person who died while diving, and that the city they are in must have been once been home to a highly advanced civilization. The divers bring the body back to the surface and begin to study it. They realize that the body is that of a woman, and that she was probably around the same age as they are. They also notice that she has a strange tattoo on her arm, which they later identify as the symbol of a mysterious cult. The divers become obsessed with learning more about the woman and the cult she belonged to. They eventually track down a living member of the cult, who tells them that the woman was a priestess who was sacrificed to the gods in order to ensure the safety of her people. The cult member also tells the divers that the woman's body must be returned to the underwater city and buried according to the cult's rituals. The divers agree to help the cult member, and they set off for the underwater city. However, when they arrive, they find that the city has been taken over by a group of criminals. The criminals have been using the city as a base for smuggling operations, and they are not happy to see the divers. The criminals capture the divers and imprison them. They interrogate the divers, trying to learn why they were there and what they know about the city. The leader of the criminals is particularly interested in the tattoo on the woman's arm, and he believes that it holds the key to finding a treasure that is hidden in the city. The divers try to escape, but they are unsuccessful. They are about to be executed when the woman's body is brought into the room. The leader of the criminals recognizes the tattoo and realizes that the divers were telling the truth. He decides to let them go and even gives them a share of the treasure. The divers return to the surface, where they share their story with the media. The story quickly becomes a sensation, and people all over the world are eager to learn more about the mysterious underwater city and the cult that once inhabited it.
