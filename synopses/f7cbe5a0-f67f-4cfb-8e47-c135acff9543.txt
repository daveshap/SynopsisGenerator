Lila is captured by agents and taken to the facility. She is interrogated and learns that the government knows about her time machine. They want to know how it works and where it came from. LILA: I'm not telling you anything! GOVERNMENT AGENT: You will tell us everything we want to know. LILA: Never! The government agents threaten Lila with violence and imprisonment, but she still refuses to talk. They eventually leave her alone in a room with the time machine. Lila is tempted to use the machine to escape, but she knows that they will be able to track her if she does. She decides to stay and try to figure out the time machine herself. However, before she can do anything, the government agents return and catch her red-handed. They drag her back to the interrogation room and demand to know how the time machine works. LILA: Fine, I'll tell you how the time machine works. But first, you have to promise me that you'll let me go. GOVERNMENT AGENT: We can't make that promise. LILA: Well, then I'm not telling you anything. After some discussion, the government agents agree to let Lila go if she tells them how the time machine works. Lila explains that the time machine is run by a power source that can be found in the future. She tells them the location of the power source and how to use it.
