A young woman, Sarah, living in New Zealand in the 3rd century BCE, is struggling to come to terms with her father's death. She is particularly close to her father, and his death has left her feeling lost and alone. In an effort to make sense of her father's death, Sarah begins reading philosophy. She is particularly drawn to the work of Socrates, and she begins to experiment with some of his ideas in her own life. Sarah's father was a great believer in the power of reason, and Sarah comes to believe that reason can help her to understand and make sense of the death of her father. Sarah continues to explore the ideas of Socrates, and she begins to find solace in philosophical discussions with her friends. She also begins to develop a deeper understanding of the relationship between the individual and the state, and the role of the individual in society. She comes to believe that it is important for individuals to think for themselves, and to question authority. This leads Sarah into conflict with the authorities in her own society, and she is eventually arrested and put on trial. Sarah is convicted and sentenced to death, but she uses her last words to deliver a powerful defense of the power of reason. Her message is that individuals should not be afraid to question authority, and to think for themselves. This speech earns Sarah a place in history as one of the first great philosophers.
