Set in the Middle East in the 4th century BCE, the story follows the exploits of a group of courageous characters who face challenges with determination, despite the odds against them. The fast-paced plot is driven by events rather than characters, and the sardonic tone is set by the snappy repartee and dry humor that characterize the banter-filled dialogue. Middle: The story picks up the pace as the characters find themselves in the middle of a battle for control of their city. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, they refuse to give up and fight bravely against overwhelming odds. In the end, they are victorious, but at a heavy cost. End: The story ends with the City in ruins and the characters scattered. But the courage and determination they have shown throughout the story gives them the strength to rebuild and start again.
