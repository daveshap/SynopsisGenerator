In 4th century BCE France, a ontological mystery is unfolding. Events are rapidly unfolding, and the pace is fast paced. The characters are behaving in ways that are authentic to their age, nationality, and background. The tone of the story is haunting, and the style is jargon-filled. The mystery deepens as the events unfold. The pace quickens as the characters race to solve the mystery. The tone turns to panic as the stakes get higher. The style becomes more complex as the jargon-filled language starts to take over. The mystery is solved, and the truth is revealed. The pace slows down as the characters reflect on what has happened. The tone turns to relief as the mystery is solved and the answered are revealed. The style starts to simplify as the jargon-filled language is no longer needed.
