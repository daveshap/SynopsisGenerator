When the world was young, it was a different place. The land was lush and green, the sun was hot, and the people were nomadic. They roamed the land, following the herds of animals they hunted. One such tribe was the Murani. They were a small tribe, but they were skilled hunters. They lived in what is now Sub-Saharan Africa, in the 4th century. One day, while the Murani were out hunting, they came across a strange sight. In the distance, they saw a man, a white man, riding a camel. He was dressed in strange clothing, and he had a long beard. The Murani tribe had never seen a white man before, and they were curious. They decided to follow him. The white man led them to an oasis in the middle of the desert. There, he set up camp. The Murani tribe was fascinated by the white man. They had never seen anyone like him before. They asked him questions about his home, and about the world beyond the desert. The white man told them that he was a traveler from a far-off land. He told them about his homeland, and about the people and animals there. He also told them about the war that was raging in his homeland. The Murani were intrigued by the white man's stories. They had never heard of war before. Eventually, the white man had to leave. He gave the Murani tribe his blessing, and he told them that he would never forget them. The Murani tribe was sad to see the white man go. But they were also excited by the new things they had learned. The Murani tribe continued to live in the desert, hunting and gathering food. They remembered the white man's stories, and they talked about them often. One day, a group of men from a neighboring tribe came to the Murani camp. They were looking for a new hunting ground, and they wanted to know if the Murani would share their land. The Murani refused. They wanted to keep their land to themselves. The men from the other tribe did not listen. They attacked the Murani camp. The Murani were outnumbered and outmatched. They were forced to flee. The Murani wanderers for many days, searching for a new place to call home. They were tired, and they were hungry. One day, they came across a small village. The village was in the middle of a lush green valley. It was a beautiful place. The Murani decided to make the village their new home. They settled down, and they began to build their homes. The village was a peaceful place. The Murani lived there for many years, and they were happy. One day, a group of men from the white man's homeland came to the village. They were looking for the white man. The Murani told the men that the white man had left many years ago. They did not know where he had gone. The men from the white man's homeland did not believe the Murani. They wanted to know where the white man was. The Murani did not know what to do. They were afraid of the men from the white man's homeland. One of the men from the white man's homeland threatened to kill the Murani chief's daughter unless the Murani told him where the white man was. The Murani chief's daughter was the only child of the chief. He loved her very much. He had no choice. He told the men from the white man's homeland where the white man was. The men from the white man's homeland took the white man captive. They wanted to take him back to their homeland to stand trial for his crimes. The Murani were sad to see the white man go. But they were also relieved that he was gone. The Murani tribe continued to live in the village. They were happy there. One day, a group of men from the white man's homeland came to the village.
