In space, on a distant planet, a group of friends is living together in a small community. One day, they receive a strange signal from an unknown source. They investigate and find a huge, abandoned spaceship. Inside, they find a powerful creature that has been trapped for centuries. They free it, and it reveals itself to be a powerful being of pure energy. It wants to help them escape the planet, but they must first find a way to get the ship running again. They manage the task and blast off into space. The creature begins to teach them about its powers and how to use them. They soon realize that they are being followed by a large, hostile ship. They prepare for battle, but the creature assures them that it will protect them. The ship attacks and they are able to defeat it, but at the cost of the creature's life. They mourn their friend, but continue on, using its powers to help them navigate their way through space. They finally reach their destination, a planet that is teeming with life. They are able to start a new life there, using the creature's powers to help them build a new community. They live happily ever after, grateful for the creature's sacrifice and the new life they have been given.
