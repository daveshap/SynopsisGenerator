In a small village in Italy, life is peaceful and idyllic. The villagers are content with their simple lives, unaware of the horrors that lurk in the dark corners of the world. One day, a strange woman arrives in the village, claiming to be a seer. She tells the villagers that they are in danger and that they must leave immediately. The villagers are skeptical, but the woman is insistent, and eventually they agree to follow her. The woman leads the villagers deep into the mountains, where they find a hidden cave system. The cave is dark and treacherous, and the villagers are soon hopelessly lost. They are attacked by a pack of savage beasts, and many of them are killed. The surviving villagers are rescued by a group of mysterious people who seem to have knowledge of the creatures. The villagers are brought to a safe haven, where they learn that the world is full of monsters and demons. The people who saved them are a group of hunters who dedicate their lives to protects others from the creatures of the night. The villagers decide to stay and help the hunters, and they quickly become a force to be reckoned with. The village is constantly besieged by attacks from the creatures of the night, and the villagers have to work together to keep them at bay. They build elaborate traps and fortifications, and they quickly become proficient in the art of monster hunting. Over time, the village grows and prospers, and the hunters become legendary. One day, the seer returns to the village with a dire warning. She tells the villagers that a great evil is coming, and that they must be prepared. The hunters set out to find the source of the evil, and they eventually discover a group of demons ritualistically sacrificing humans to a dark god. The demons are powerful and numerous, and the villagers are quickly overwhelmed. The hunters fight bravely, but they are outnumbered and outmatched. Just when all hope seems lost, the villagers receive help from an unlikely source. A group of humans who have been living in hiding, dedicated to fighting the demons, arrives and helps turn the tide of battle. Together, the humans and hunters triumph over the demons and chase them back into the darkness. The village is saved, but the battle has taken a toll. The hunters are heroes, but many of them have been lost. The village mourns the loss of the hunters, but they also celebrate their victory. The demons have been driven back, but the villagers know that they will return one day. The humans and the hunters have formed a truce, and they vow to protect the village and its people from the creatures of the night.
