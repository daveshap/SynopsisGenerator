Teenage Martians are going through the rite of passage that includes a controversial religious ritual. The ritual itself is a test of will and bravery, where the young Martian is left stranded on the Martian surface overnight with only a knife and their wits to survive. If they can make it through the night, they are considered an adult. However, things are different this time around. The night is filled with strange noises and atmospheric disturbances, and the young Martian is soon joined by a religious figure from another planet who is on a mission to Mars. Together, they must try to survive the night and find out what is causing the strange disturbances. As the two characters try to survive the night, they slowly start to piece together what is happening. They realize that the Mars is going through a cataclysmic event that will destroy all life on the planet. The only way to survive is to get to one of the Martian underground cities that are protected from the surface conditions. However, getting there will not be easy. They must fight their way through hostile Martian wildlife, brave the Martian environment, and outwit the religious figures who are trying to stop them. The two characters eventually make it to the underground city and are able to warn the inhabitants of the impending cataclysm. They are hailed as heroes and given a place of honor in the city. The city is able to survive the cataclysm, but the surface of Mars is left a barren wasteland. The two characters must now find a way to rebuild their lives and find a new home.
