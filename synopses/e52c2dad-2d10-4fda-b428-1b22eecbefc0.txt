Three astronomers -- one American, one Russian, and one Chinese -- are monitoring a strange phenomenon in space. A strange energy field is expanding from a point in the universe, and it's headed toward Earth. The energy field is first detected by the American astronomer, who immediately notifies the other two. They confirm thereading and start tracking the field's progress. As the field approaches Earth, it causes strange effects on the planet. The atmosphere starts to change, and the weather becomes unpredictable. The three astronomers race to find a way to warn the people of Earth about the approaching danger. But before they can, the energy field reaches Earth and envelops the planet. The energy field has a dramatic effect on the people of Earth. They start to experience strange powers and abilities. Some people develop telekinesis, while others become telepathic. Some gain the ability to fly, while others can walk through walls. The strangest thing is that everyone's abilities are different. Some people can do things that others can't. And no one knows why. As the people of Earth try to come to grips with their new abilities, the world around them starts to change. The energy field is affecting the very fabric of reality. Time and space start to break down, and alternate universes start to bleed into our own. creatures from other dimensions start to appear. The world is in chaos, and the people of Earth must find a way to deal with their new abilities and the changing reality around them. In the end, the people of Earth find a way to use their new abilities to restore order to the world. They learn to control their abilities and use them for good. The energy field is gone, but the people of Earth are forever changed. They have become something more than human. They are now a force for good in the universe.
