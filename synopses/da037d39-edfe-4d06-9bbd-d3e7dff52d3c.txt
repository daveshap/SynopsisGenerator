In a small Australian town in an alternative timeline, twelve year old Scout Chapman is getting ready for another day of school. She's not looking forward to it, since she's been bullied by the other kids for being different. Scout has always been fascinated by the wilderness, and she spends her free time exploring the forests and mountains around her town. One day, Scout finds a strange artifact in the forest - a strange looking rock that seems to be glowing. She takes it home to show her father, who is a professor at the local university. He doesn't know what it is, but he's excited by the find. That night, Scout has a strange dream. She sees a huge, ancient tree in the middle of the forest, and a voice tells her to find the tree and climb to the top. The next day, Scout decides to skip school and go looking for the tree. She finds it easily enough, but when she tries to climb it, she falls and hurts herself. She's rescued by a mysterious stranger, who tells her that she's been chosen to save the world. Confused and scared, Scout falls unconscious. She wakes up in a strange place, where she's greeted by a creature who looks like a cross between a kangaroo and a koala. This is the first of many amazing and wondrous creatures she will meet on her journey. The creature tells her that the world is in danger, and that she must find the six lost keys of magic in order to save it. He gives her a map and sends her on her way. Scout sets off on her journey, facing many dangers and making new friends along the way. She slowly starts to piece together the mystery of the lost keys, and as she does, she realizes that she might be the only one who can save the world. Scout's journey takes her all over Australia, and she faces many challenges along the way. She meets strange and wonderful creatures, and she discovers that the lost keys of magic are actually the six spirit animals of the world. As she gets closer to finding all the keys, Scout also gets closer to the enemy who is trying to stop her. This enemy is a powerful sorcerer, who wants to use the keys to destroy the world. Scout's task becomes even more urgent when she discovers that the sorcerer has already found three of the keys. She knows that she has to find the remaining three keys before he does, or the world will be lost forever. In the final part of her journey, Scout faces her greatest challenges. She faces the sorcerer in a final battle, and she also has to confront her own fears and doubts. She knows that she can't give up, even if the odds seem impossible. In the end, Scout is successful in finding all the keys of magic. She defeats the sorcerer and saves the world. She returns home to her small town, where she is finally accepted by her classmates. The world is safe, and Scout has found her place in it. She knows that she's make a difference, and that her journey was just the beginning.
