It is the beginning of summer in Italy and archaeologists are busy excavating a Bronze Age site. One of the workers, a young woman named Lia, discovers a strange object buried in the ground. It is a small, statue of a creepy looking creature with long claws. Lia takes the statue to her supervisor, Dr. Rossi, who is unable to identify it. Dr. Rossi sends a photo of the statue to a colleague, who tells him that it is an artifact from a lost civilization. Meanwhile, a detective named Carlo is investigating the death of a young woman. The woman's body was found in a strange position and her death is mysterious. Carlo begins to suspect that she was murdered. He interviews the woman's friends and family, but no one seems to know anything about her death. As Carlo investigates the woman's death, he discovers that she was involved in a secretive group that was interested in the Bronze Age. He also finds out that she was close to Dr. Rossi. Carlo begins to suspect that Dr. Rossi knows more about the woman's death than he is letting on. As Carlo's investigation continues, he discovers that Dr. Rossi was actually looking for the Bronze Age civilization that created the statue. He believes that the civilization was destroyed by a natural disaster, but he thinks that some of the members may have survived. Dr. Rossi thinks that the woman's death is connected to the Bronze Age civilization and he is convinced that Carlo can help him find out more. Carlo is initially hesitant to get involved, but he is eventually convinced by Dr. Rossi. The two men begin to search for the lost civilization. They have many adventures and they meet many interesting people along the way. They also discover that the Bronze Age civilization was not destroyed by a natural disaster, but by a group of people who were afraid of their power. The closer Carlo and Dr. Rossi get to the truth, the more dangerous it becomes. The people who killed the Bronze Age civilization are still alive and they will do anything to keep the truth hidden. Carlo and Dr. Rossi are eventually captured by the killers, who take them to an isolated place in the mountains. FINALE: Carlo and Dr. Rossi are able to escape from their captors and they make their way back to civilisation. They go to the police and they tell them everything they know about the lost Bronze Age civilization and the people who killed it. The police are sceptical at first, but they eventually believe Carlo and Dr. Rossi. They launch an investigation and they eventually catch the killers. Carlo and Dr. Rossi's adventure has made them closer friends and they continue to work together on projects. They are eventually able to prove the existence of the lost Bronze Age civilization and they help to preserve its legacy.
