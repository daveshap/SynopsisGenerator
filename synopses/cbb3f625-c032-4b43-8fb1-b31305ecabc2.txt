In the year 4th century BCE, a series of terrible wars were fought in the Pacific region. One of these conflicts was the War of the hundredth day, which began when a group of people from the island of Thera attempted to land on the island of Melos. The Melians were quickly defeated, and the Therans took control of the island. The Therans then tried to take the nearby island of Crete, but they were met with stiff resistance from the Cretans. The Cretans had been preparing for war, and they had acquired a powerful weapon: a large wooden horse filled with soldiers. The Therans attempted to take the horse by force, but they were quickly defeated. The Cretans then took the Theran island of Naxos, and they began to prepare for a long and brutal war. The war continued for many years, and it eventually spread to the mainland. The Cretans and Therans both fought bravely, but the Cretans had the advantage. They had better weapons and better training, and they slowly began to push the Therans back. The Therans began to despair, and they decided to ask for help from the gods. They consulted an oracle, who told them to sacrifice their best warrior to the god Ares. The Therans agreed, and they chose their best fighter: a woman named Deidameia. Deidameia was taken to the top of a mountain and sacrificed, and her blood flowed down onto the earth. As her blood soaked into the ground, it turned into a powerful substance that gave strength and speed to the Therans. The Therans began to win more battles, and they eventually pushed the Cretans all the way back to their island. The Cretans were desperate, and they decided to use their last weapon: the wooden horse. They loaded the horse onto a ship and sailed it to the Theran island of Naxos. The horse was unloaded and left in a public square, and the Cretans then sailed away. The Therans were curious about the horse, and they decided to open it. As soon as they did, soldiers jumped out and began to attack. The Therans were caught by surprise, and they were quickly defeated. With the Therans defeated, the Cretans took control of the entire Pacific region. The Cretans ruled the Pacific for many years, but their grip on power was eventually weakening. The Therans, led by Deidameiaâ€™s husband, Aristodemus, began to rebel. Aristodemus gathered an army and attacked the Cretan island of Naxos. The Cretans were taken by surprise, and they were quickly defeated. The Therans then began to liberate the other islands in the Pacific. After years of fighting, the Therans were finally victorious. The Cretans were driven out of the Pacific, and the Therans took control of the region. Aristodemus and Deidameia were hailed as heroes, and their story became an important part of Theran history.
