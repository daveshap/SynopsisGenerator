It is the 17th century in China, and the country is in a time of great turmoil. The Ming Dynasty has collapsed and the Manchu Qing Dynasty has taken over. There is a lot of political unrest and many people are dissatisfied with the new regime. Two characters, Liu and Deng, are introduced. They are friends who have grown up together and are now in their early twenties. They are both very patriotic and believe strongly in China's greatness. One day, they witness a group of Manchu soldiers abusing a local peasant. They are outraged and decide to do something about it. They start by Harassing the Manchu soldiers and quickly escalate to more serious acts of rebellion. As their acts of rebellion become more and more daring, Liu and Deng quickly gain a reputation. More and more people start joining their cause and they become leaders of a small resistance movement. They quickly realize that they are in way over their heads. The Manchu authorities are clamping down on dissent and are using increasingly brutal methods to quell the uprising. Liu and Deng are wanted men, and they know that it is only a matter of time before they are caught. One night, they are ambushed by a group of Manchu soldiers. In the ensuing fight, Liu is seriously injured and Deng is killed. Liu is captured and taken to the capital, where he is interrogated and tortured. Liu is finally broken and reveals the names of his accomplices. He is then executed publicly. The Manchu authorities crack down even harder on the resistance movement. Many of Liu and Deng's followers are arrested and executed. The resistance is effectively stamped out and China remains under Manchu rule for many years to come.
