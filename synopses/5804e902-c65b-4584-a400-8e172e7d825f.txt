In the year 3001, the human race has colonized the solar system and peace reigns throughout the planets. However, when a new threat appears, the people of Earth must band together to find a way to save themselves. Enter the Oompa-Loompas, a race of small, orange-skinned creatures who seem to have the ability to communicate with the creatures of the cosmos. The Oompa-Loompas agree to help the humans and teach them the ways of musical theater, which they believe will save them from their impending doom. With the Oompa-Loompasâ€™ help, the people of Earth learn about the importance of musical theater and begin to produce their own shows. They quickly learn that the power of music can transcend space and time, and that it can even be used to fight the evil forces that are threatening their planet. With their new-found knowledge, the humans put on an spectacular intergalactic musical that is so moving and empowering, that it not only saves their own planet, but also brings peace to the entire solar system. In the end, the humans and the Oompa-Loompas become fast friends, and the solar system is saved thanks to the power of musical theater.
