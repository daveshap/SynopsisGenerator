In the early 21st century, Europe is in the throes of a full-blown economic crisis. Unemployment is skyrocketing, poverty is widespread, and crime is on the rise. To make matters worse, the European Union is on the brink of collapse. In the midst of all this chaos, a group of young people from all over Europe decide to take matters into their own hands. They form a resistance group called the European Youth Liberation Front, and their goal is to overthrow the corrupt European Union and establish a new social order. The group quickly gains popularity, and their ranks swell with new recruits. The European Youth Liberation Front quickly becomes the most powerful force in Europe, and they are not afraid to use violence to achieve their goals. The group's leader is a charismatic young Italian man named Carlo. He is a passionate and idealistic young man, and he quickly becomes the face of the European Youth Liberation Front. The group's activities soon catch the attention of the European media, and they become the subject of intensive media scrutiny. The European Youth Liberation Front is now a household name, and their message is resonating with people all over Europe. As the group's popularity grows, so does the government's resolve to crush them. The European Union deploys all of its resources to track down and arrest the members of the European Youth Liberation Front. A massive manhunt is launched, and Carlo and his comrades are forced to go into hiding. They continue to wage their war against the European Union, but they are now fighting a losing battle. One by one, the members of the European Youth Liberation Front are captured or killed. Finally, only Carlo remains. He is wounded and exhausted, but he refuses to give up. He makes one final, desperate attempt to bring down the European Union. He hijacked a plane and crash it into the European Parliament building in Brussels. Carlo is killed in the explosion, but his martyrdom inspires a new generation of young people to continue the fight against the European Union.
