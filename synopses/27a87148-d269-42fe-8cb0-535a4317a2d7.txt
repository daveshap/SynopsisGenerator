It is the far future. The world is now a Pacific-centered empire and society. A new age of exploration and colonization has begun, led by the great Emperorate. Our story follows a group of Imperial scouts as they travel to a newly discovered world. Using their advanced technology, they are able to quickly map the entire planet and find the perfect spot to begin their new colony. However, as they make their final preparations, they are suddenly attacked by an unknown enemy. Fierce fighting ensues, and eventually the enemy is repelled, but not before doing major damage to the Imperial ship. Our heroes are now stranded on the hostile world with no way to call for help. In the days that follow, they begin to explore their new surroundings and realize that they are not alone on this planet. They soon come into contact with the native population, a group of warlike people who are distrustful of the Imperials. Through a series of clever negotiations and daring military operations, our heroes are able to win the trust of the natives and forge an alliance with them. With the help of their new allies, the Imperials are finally able to repair their ship and make their way back home. They have accomplished their mission, but not without cost. Many of their comrades have been lost, but the experience has made them all stronger and wiser. They return to a hero's welcome, having made a significant contribution to the expansion of the Emperorate.
