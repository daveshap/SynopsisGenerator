In the year 78 AD, a young girl named Claudia is living in Rome with her wealthy parents. When her father is accused of treason, he is sentenced to death and Claudia is forced to watch as he is executed. This event leaves her with a hatred for the Roman Empire and a determination to seek revenge. Claudia begins working as a spy for the rebels, relaying information about Roman troop movements and military plans. She quickly becomes one of the most valuable assets to the rebel cause. However, her activities eventually attract the attention of the Roman authorities and she is captured. Imprisoned and facing execution, Claudia is rescued by a rebel soldier named Viktor. He takes her to safety and helps her to continue the fight against the Roman Empire. Together, Claudia and Viktor begin working to overthrow the Roman Empire from within. They gather more rebels to their cause and launch a series of daring attacks against the Empire. As the rebellion grows, so does Claudia's hatred for the Romans. Claudia and Viktor's rebel army continues to grow, and they begin to gain ground against the Romans. However, the going is tough and they suffer many losses. In one particularly brutal battle, Viktor is killed. This event sends Claudia into a rage. She becomes even more determined to drive the Romans out of her homeland. She leads the rebels in a series of increasingly bold and dangerous attacks, determined to avenge Viktor's death. The rebels begin to win more and more battles, and Claudia's reputation as a fierce warrior grows. However, the Romans are not about to give up easily. They send their best general, Lucius, to crush the rebellion. Lucius is a ruthless and cunning leader, and he quickly begins to turn the tide against the rebels. Claudia is forced to retreat and regroup. She knows that she needs to find a way to defeat Lucius if the rebellion is to have any hope of success. Claudia hatches a daring plan to lure Lucius into a trap. She sets up a fake rebel base in a remote location and spreads the word that she is planning to launch a major offensive from there. When Lucius hears about this, he leads his troops to the location, expecting an easy victory. However, he arrives to find that it is a trap. Claudia and the rebels attack, and Lucius is killed in the ensuing battle. With the death of their leader, the Roman troops begin to lose heart. Claudia and the rebels take advantage of this and launch a series of attacks that quickly drive the Romans out of her homeland. The rebellion is over and Claudia is victorious. She has fulfilled her revenge and freed her people from the Roman yoke.
