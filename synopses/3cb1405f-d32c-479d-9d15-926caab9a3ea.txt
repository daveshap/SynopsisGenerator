In the land of the Pharaohs, in the year 2424 BCE, a young boy named Tuthmosis is born. His mother dies in childbirth, and his father, Pharaoh Akhenaten, is so grief-stricken that he renounces the old gods of Egypt and proclaims himself a god. Tuthmosis is raised in the royal palace and grows up a mischievous child, always getting into trouble. Under the guidance of his tutors, Tuthmosis learns about the history of Egypt and the old gods. He also learns about his father's beliefs and the new religion of Aten. When he is ten years old, his father dies and Tuthmosis becomes Pharaoh. Tuthmosis is soon confronted with the task of ruling Egypt. He faces many challenges, including rebellions, droughts, and invasions. Nevertheless, he manages to keep Egypt stable and prosperous. In his twenties, Tuthmosis takes a wife, Queen Nefertiti, and they have a daughter, Princess Ankhesenamun. Tuthmosis is a loving husband and father, and he and Nefertiti are very happy together. Unfortunately, the people of Egypt are not content with Akhenaten's actiions and they begin to openly oppose him. Tuthmosis knows that he must do something to quell the unrest. Therefore, he announces that Egypt will return to the worship of the old gods. This placates the people for a time, but shortly thereafter, they begin to rebel again. This time, Tuthmosis crushed the rebellion with an iron fist. He had the leaders of the revolt publicly executed, and he put Egypt under strict military rule.
