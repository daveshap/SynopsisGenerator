It is the 4th century BCE, and the Persian Empire has just been conquered by Alexander the Great. In the aftermath of this momentous event, a small group of survivors from the defeated army make their way to North Africa. Among them is a young man named Darius, who is determined to build a new life for himself and his fellow countrymen. Darius quickly discovers that the land in North Africa is rich and fertile, and that the local people are friendly and welcoming. He also finds that there are many opportunities for him to put his skills to use, and soon he has established himself as a successful farmer. However, Darius is not content to simply live a peaceful and idyllic life in his new home. He is ambitious, and he soon begins to form a plan to build a new city, which he will call Babylon. Darius is aware that there are other city-states in the region, but he is confident that he can create a city that will be superior to all the others. To realize his dream, Darius enlisted the help of his fellow countrymen, and together they set to work. Over the course of several years, they slowly but surely build Babylon into a thriving metropolis. Darius' vision comes to fruition, and Babylon quickly becomes the most prosperous and powerful city in North Africa. However, not everyone is happy with Darius' success. There are those who envy his wealth and power, and who plot to oust him from his position. Darius is aware of the danger, but he is not willing to give up what he has worked so hard to achieve. The conflict comes to a head when Darius' enemies launch a surprise attack on Babylon. Although they are outnumbered and outgunned, the defenders of the city put up a brave fight. However, they are eventually defeated, and Darius is captured. Darius is brought before the leaders of his enemies, who demand that he surrender the city. Darius refuses, and he is sentenced to death. However, he is given a choice: he can either be executed immediately, or he can be given a chance to redeem himself. Darius chooses the latter option, and he is given a task: he must journey to the city of Babylon and find the legendary treasure that is said to be hidden there. If he is successful, he will be pardoned and allowed to return to his own city. Darius sets out on his quest, and he soon discovers that the city of Babylon is a strange and confusing place. He has a series of adventures, both good and bad, as he tries to find the treasure. Along the way, he gradually comes to realize that the treasure is not material wealth, but something much more valuable: the love and respect of his fellow countrymen. Darius finally completes his quest, and he is pardoned and allowed to return to his own city. He is welcomed back with open arms, and he quickly resumes his position as leader of the city. Under Darius' guidance, the city of Babylon thrives. It becomes a hub of culture and learning, and its people live prosperous and peaceful lives. Darius' dream has become a reality, and Babylon is truly the greatest city in North Africa.
