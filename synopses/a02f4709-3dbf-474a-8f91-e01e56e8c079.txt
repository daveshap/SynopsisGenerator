The story begins on a remote planet in another galaxy ruled by a monarchy. The planet is at war with another planet in the same galaxy. The queen of the planet is pregnant and close to giving birth. As she is about to give birth, the queen's husband, the king, is killed in battle. The queen gives birth to twins, a boy and a girl. The queen dies shortly after giving birth, leaving the twins orphaned. A group of men from the king's army take the twins and flee the planet. The men are from different religions and the twins are raised with different religious beliefs. The men eventually settle on a remote planet that is inhabited by a race of intelligent beings that resemble animals. The men raise the twins as their own and teach them the ways of their different religions. The twins grow up to be strong and intelligent. They both inherit their mother's ability to use magic. The girl is able to use magic to heal people and the boy is able to use magic to control the elements. The twins grow up thinking that they are the only humans on the planet. They are content living with the men and their animal-like companions. One day, when the twins are teens, a spaceship lands on the planet. A group of humans step out of the ship and are shocked to see the twins. The humans explain that they are from Earth and that the twin's parents were from a royal family on Earth. The humans tell the twins that they are the rightful heirs to the throne of Earth and that they need to come with them to take their rightful place as king and queen. The humans also explain that the planet they are from is in danger of being destroyed by a black hole. The only way to save the planet is for the twins to use their magic to close the black hole. The humans take the twins back to Earth. The twins are sceptical at first, but they eventually come to accept that they are the rightful rulers of Earth. They use their magic to close the black hole and save the planet. In the process, they learn that they are not alone in the universe and that there are other humans out there. The twins rule Earth for many years and eventually have children of their own. They pass their magic down to their children and teach them the ways of their different religions. The children grow up and have children of their own. The cycle continues for generations. The story ends with the twins' great-great-great-great-grandchildren. They are the last of the royal line on Earth. They are presented with the same choice that their ancestors were given: to stay on Earth and rule it, or to leave and explore the universe. They decide to leave Earth and explore the universe. They leave their children in the care of their trusted advisors and set off into the vast unknown.
