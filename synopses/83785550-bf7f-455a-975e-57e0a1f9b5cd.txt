He starts seeing things that no one else can see, and hearing voices that no one else can hear. Everyone around him starts to think that he is crazy, and Phedon starts to believe it too. One day, Phedon meets a woman named Daphne who tells him that he is not crazy, and that the things he is seeing and hearing are real.
