In Brazil, during the early classical period, Nazis are randomly attacking and slaughtering people. A young woman, Lia, is on the run from them. She is terrified and has no idea what to do. She meets a man, Rio, who tells her that the only way to escape the Nazis is to go to the Amazon. They travel there, but the Nazis find them and kill Rio. Lia is captured and taken to a concentration camp where she is tortured and brutalized. Lia manages to escape the concentration camp and makes her way back to the Amazon. She is now determined to find a way to stop the Nazis. She meets a group of guerrilla fighters who are also fighting the Nazis. They help her to get training and supplies. Lia becomes a skilled fighter and leads a series of daring attacks against the Nazis. She quickly becomes known as the "Amazon Warrior." Lia's attacks become increasingly bold and daring. The Nazis are now desperate to stop her. They offer a large bounty for her capture. Lia is eventually betrayed by one of her fighters and is captured. She is taken back to the concentration camp and executed.
