In a Kingdom far below the waves, there live two races of people. The first are the Expert swimmers, who have fish-like tails and can breathe both air and water. They are the peaceful ones, living in harmony with the sea-life and each other. The second race are the Surface-dwellers, who have legs and can only breathe air. They are a war-like people, always fighting amongst themselves and with the Expert swimmers. The story begins with a young Surface-dweller girl, who is about to be married off to a man she does not love. On the night before her wedding, she decides to run away and check out the world beyond her small village. She climbs up to the top of a tall cliff, and looks out at the vast ocean. She has always been told that if she ventures too far out, the sea-monsters will get her. However, she is curious and decides to take the plunge. She is immediately attacked by a giant octopus, but is saved by a handsome young Expert swimmer. He takes her back to his undersea kingdom and introduces her to his family and friends. She is amazed by the beauty of their world and the friendly people. The Surface-dwellers are always at war with each other, and she has never seen such peace and harmony. The young couple falls in love and gets married. However, the girl is soon homesick and misses her family. She decides to go back to the surface to visit her parents, but finds that her village has been destroyed by a rival clan. Her parents are dead, and she is the only survivor. The young couple decides to start a new life together and build a village of their own. They gather all the Surface-dwellers who are willing to live in peace and harmony, and create a new kingdom under the sea. The story ends with the young couple's children playing together in the waves, symbolizing the new beginning of the two races.
