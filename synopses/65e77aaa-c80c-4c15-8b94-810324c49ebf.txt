In a future Europe that has been left in ruin following a series of cataclysmic events, a group of survivors come across an abandoned amusement park. Inside, they find a strange creature that looks like a cross between a cat and a human. The creature tells them that the amusement park is a safe haven for those who are looking to escape the outside world. The group decides to stay in the park, and the creature, who they call Mr. Fuzzybottom, becomes their leader. They build a small society within the park, and over time, the members of the group begin to transform into anthropomorphic animals. They develop their own language and culture, and the park becomes their new home. However, the outside world is not as forgiving as the park, and the group soon discovers that they are not the only ones seeking refuge in the park. There are other groups of survivors, some of whom are hostile and want to take the park for themselves. The group must band together to fight off the other survivors and protect their new home. They must also contend with the ever-changing landscape of the park, which is slowly being taken over by nature. The group eventually succumbs to the hostile forces outside the park, and Mr. Fuzzybottom is killed. However, the other members of the group continue to live in the park, and their society persists. The park becomes a symbol of hope for the people of the outside world, and the group's story is passed down through the generations.
