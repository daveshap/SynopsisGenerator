Life in Korea is far different in the future. The country is run by a totalitarian government, and the people are kept in line through strict controls and surveillance. One group that is constantly monitored is the student population. Any hint of dissent or protest is quickly squashed. But there are some students who are not afraid to stand up to the government. They begin to plan a demonstration to demand more freedom and liberalization. As they make their preparations, the authorities become aware of their plans and move to stop them. The students are undeterred by the government's attempts to stop them. They go ahead with their demonstration, and it quickly turns into a full-blown riot. The police move in to quell the violence, but the students are determined to stand their ground. The authorities are caught off-guard by the students' defiance, and the riots continue to spread. The government is forced to take increasingly harsh measures to try to control the situation. The students, meanwhile, are inspired by their own success and continue to fight for their beliefs. The government's crackdown on the student protesters turns brutal. Many of the students are killed or imprisoned. But the uprising has sparked a movement for change, and the people of Korea are beginning to demand more freedom and democracy. The authorities are no longer able to keep a lid on the discontent, and the country is slowly moving towards a more open society.
