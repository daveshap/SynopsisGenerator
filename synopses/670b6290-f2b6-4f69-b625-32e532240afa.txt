In a future underwater world, twelve year old Aqua is finishing up her final year of schooling. She and her classmates are eager to move on to the next phase of their lives, but first they must complete their final exams. Aqua is confident she will do well, but she is surprised when she scores lower than expected. Her parents tell her not to worry, and that she will have other opportunities to prove herself. Aqua is determined to do better next time, and sets off on a journey to improve her skills. Aqua meets a variety of interesting characters during her travels, including a friendly mermaid named Pearl. Pearl helps Aqua to realize that she has been so focused on doing well in school that she has been missing out on enjoying life. Aqua begins to see the world in a new way, and starts to appreciate the things she has been missing. She also meets a boy named Trident, who she quickly falls for. Trident is from a different part of the underwater world, and is unfamiliar with Aqua's culture. Aqua is initially hesitant to get involved with him, but she slowly begins to open up. The two eventually start dating, and Aqua is happy to have found someone she can truly connect with. Aqua and Trident's relationship is put to the test when they are both accepted into different schools. Trident is offered a place at a prestigious academy, while Aqua is only accepted into her second choice school. Aqua is reluctant to leave Trident, but she knows it is an opportunity she can't pass up. The two eventually decide to part ways, but they promise to stay in touch. Aqua is sad to see Trident go, but she knows they will always have a special connection.
