The story opens with the narrator describing the planet Earth in the year 21xx. The world is a very different place than it is today, with advanced technology and other strange phenomena. One of the most prominent changes is the existence of superpowers, which have given rise to a new type of hero: the superhero. The story follows the adventures of one such superhero, a young woman named Urania. Urania was born with the superpowers of flight and super strength. She discovered her powers when she was just a child, and she quickly began using them to help people. Urania is a member of a team of superheroes called the Guardians. The Guardians are the protectors of the world, and they use their powers to fight crime and stop evil. They are constantly fighting against a variety of enemies, both human and superpowered. One day, the Guardians are called to action when a group of super-villains called the Revengers attack a major city. The Revengers are a group of criminals with powers similar to the Guardians. They have declared war on the world, and they are determined to destroy the Guardians. The Guardians battle the Revengers, but they are eventually outnumbered and outmatched. The Revengers capture several of the Guardians, including Urania. The remaining Guardians are forced to flee, and they are scattered across the world. Urania is taken to the Revengers' base, where she is held captive. The Revengers torture and interrogate her, but she refuses to divulge any information about the Guardians. The Revengers eventually tire of trying to get information from her, and they decide to kill her. Just as the Revengers are about to kill Urania, she is saved by the timely arrival of the other Guardians. The Guardians battle the Revengers and save Urania. The Revengers are defeated, and the Guardians are victorious. After the battle, the Guardians regroup and discuss what to do next. They decide to go on the offensive, and they launch an all-out assault on the Revengers' base. The Guardians defeat the Revengers and finally bring peace to the world. The story ends with the Guardians being hailed as heroes. They are celebrated by the people of the world, and they live happily ever after.
