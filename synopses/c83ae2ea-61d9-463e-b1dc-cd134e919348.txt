Originating from a poor family in Germany, Romanus is used to hardships. When he's orphaned at a young age, he's completely on his own. Struggling to survive, he does whatever it takes to get by. Despite his situation, Romanus keeps his head up and his sense of humor, making the best of things. One day, Romanus meets a wealthy man named Faustus who takes an interest in him. Faustus offers to help Romanus improve his life and makes him an offer he can't refuse. Romanus begins working for Faustus and quickly rises through the ranks. Under Faustus's guidance, Romanus learns how to survive and thrive in Germany's cutthroat world. He quickly becomes one of the most successful people in the country. However, Faustus's true intentions become clear and Romanus must decide whether to betray the only person who has ever cared for him or to stay loyal and risk everything. As Romanus's success grows, so does Faustus's thirst for power. Romanus begins to see Faustus for the manipulativeist opportunist he really is. Faustus starts making increasingly dangerous demands of Romanus, who knows that if he doesn't comply, he'll be killed. Faustus's grip on Romanus tightens as he forces him to do more and more unethical things. Romanus knows that he's in over his head but he can't see a way out. He's completely under Faustus's control. At the same time, Romanus falls in love with a woman named Helene. She's from a wealthy family and completely out of Romanus's league. However, their love is real and Romanus is determined to find a way to be with her. Faustus finds out about Romanus's relationship with Helene and uses it to his advantage. He blackmails Romanus into doing an even more dangerous job for him. If Romanus doesn't comply, Faustus will kill Helene. Faced with an impossible choice, Romanus does what he has to do to save the woman he loves. He makes a deal with the Devil, not knowing what the consequences will be. Romanus sells his soul to Faustus in exchange for Helene's safety. However, Faustus is a master of deception and he doesn't hold up his end of the bargain. Romanus loses everything: his wealth, his position, and his liberty. Imprisoned and tortured, Romanus suffers for his foolishness. He wishes he had never made the deal with Faustus. He regrets ever meeting the man who has ruined his life. Just when Romanus has given up all hope, Helene comes to see him in prison. She's been searching for him ever since he disappeared. She tells him that she still loves him and she's going to help him escape. Romanus is finally able to make his escape and he and Helene start a new life together. They're finally free of Faustus's control. They're happy and in love, and they have each other.
