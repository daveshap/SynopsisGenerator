Think like a professional author. Brainstorm an extremely long complete, detailed synopsis for a novel with the following appeal terms:


GENRE: Psychological Thriller
SETTING: Scandinavia
TIME PERIOD: Early classical
STORY TYPE: Own voices: Here the protagonist and the author share a marginalized identity.
PACE: Leisurely paced: Due to descriptive language, focus on detail, or careful development of character or setting, these books unfold slowly, allowing the reader to savor the narrative.
CHARACTER: Culturally diverse: These books may feature characters from racial and ethnic minorities living in the United States, Europe, Canada, or Australia, as well as characters from non-white cultural groups living in other parts of the world.
STORY TONE: Noisy: Because of rousing, energetic pictures or text, these stories lend themselves to loud readings.
WRITING STYLE: Compelling: These powerful books draw readers irresistibly into the story.


Brainstorm an extremely long and highly detailed complete plot synopsis with beginning, middle, and end. Include character and setting names. Vividly depict the entire novel.
