BEGINNING:

==========

In the ruins of a grand empire, two young orphans scrabble to survive. They eke out a meager living in the abandoned city, picking through the rubble for anything of value. One day, they find a strange object among the debris. It is a stone statue of a demon, half-buried in the dirt. The two children take the statue and try to sell it, but no one will buy it. Finally, they take it to the local temple in desperation. The priests there recognize it as a ancient and powerful artifact. The children are given a large sum of money for the statue and told to never come back. The two orphans, now rich, leave the city and make their way to the capital. There, they begin to build a new life. They quickly learn that the world is a dangerous place, and that their new wealth makes them targets for thieves and con-artists. They are constantly on the lookout for danger, but they also take care to enjoy their newfound wealth. They buy lavish clothes and fine food, and they live in the best parts of town. One day, they are approached by a man who tells them that he knows of a great treasure. He says that it is hidden in a temple in the far-off land of India. The man tells them that he will take them there, and that they will be able to keep all of the treasure for themselves. The two orphans are excited by the prospect of untold riches, and so they agree to go along with the man. The journey is long and hard, but eventually they reach India. The temple is shrouded in mystery, and it is said to be guarded by a demon. The man tells the two orphans to wait outside while he goes in to get the treasure. They wait for hours, but he does not come out. They decide to go in and look for him. Inside the temple, they find the man lying dead on the floor. Nearby is a great treasure trove, piled high with gold and jewels. As they reach for the treasure, they are confronted by the demon. It is a fearsome sight, but the two orphans are not afraid. They stand their ground and fight the demon, slaying it with their bare hands. They then claim the treasure as their own and return to the capital, where they live happily ever after. END: The story concludes with the two orphans returning to the capital, where they live happily ever after. They are now rich beyond their wildest dreams, and they have proven that they are brave and resourceful. They have overcome great odds to claim the treasure, and they will no doubt continue to have adventures in the future.
