BEGINNING:

==========

Ivar, a young man of Scandinavian descent, is tormented by inner demons. In an effort to understand and control them, he turns to drug use and involvement in the occult. He quickly discovers that both only serve to make him feel more disconnected from the world around him. One night, Ivar experiences a powerful vision in which he is contacted by what he believes to be otherworldly forces. These entities tell him that he is special and that he has the power to change the world. They charge him with the task of carrying out their will on Earth. Ivar is hesitant at first, but after some coaxing, he eventually agrees to start down the path they have laid out for him. He immediately begins to feel a sense of purpose and direction that he has been lacking in his life up until this point. Ivar's first task is to find and recruit others who have been contacted by the same force. He starts by reaching out to his friends and acquaintances who have also experimented with drugs and the occult. He is soon able to convince a small group of people to join him on his quest. With his newly formed team, Ivar begins to carry out the tasks that the entities have set for him. They quickly discover that they have a shared gift of clairvoyance and begin using it to help others. They start small, using their abilities to help people with personal problems. But as their confidence grows, they begin to take on larger and more public cases. They quickly become well-known for their abilities to solve seemingly unsolvable problems. The group's popularity grows, and they begin to attract the attention of powerful people both inside and outside of the government. Ivar quickly realizes that he and his team are in possession of a valuable commodity. At the same time, the entities that have been guiding Ivar begin to demand more and more from him. They want him to use his power to further their agenda and to bring about their version of the future. Ivar is torn between his allegiance to the entities and his growing sense of responsibility to the people he has sworn to help. He knows that he must choose one path or the other, but he is not sure which one is right. MIDDLE: Ivar decides to follow the entities' directives and use his power to further their agenda. He and his team begin to work behind the scenes to manipulate events and people to bring about the future that the entities have envisioned. They are successful in many of their endeavors, but as they become more embroiled in the machinations of the world, they begin to lose sight of their original goals. Ivar starts to become consumed by power and greed. The team starts to fracture as some members grow disillusioned with Ivar's actions. They begin to question whether they are really making a difference or if they are just pawns in a larger game. As the team continues to fall apart, Ivar's grip on reality begins to slip. He starts to hallucinate and have visions of the future. He becomes convinced that he is destined to rule the world. With the team in disarray and Ivar's mental state deteriorating, the entities that have been guiding him begin to lose patience. They demand that he finish the task they have set for him and bring about their vision of the future. Ivar, however, is no longer interested in following their directives. He is now obsessed with his own power and goals. He turns on the entities and tries to destroy them. The entities, however, are far more powerful than Ivar. They easily defeat him and cast him out of their world. Ivar is left alone and broken. He has lost everything that was important to him. He is now a shell of his former self. END: Ivar's story ends with him bitter and resentful of the world. He is a washed-uphas-been who is no longer relevant. He fades into obscurity and is eventually forgotten.
