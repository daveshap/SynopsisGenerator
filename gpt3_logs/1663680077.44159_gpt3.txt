BEGINNING:

==========

Rosaline Mars was only five years old when her parents were killed in a freak accident. Orphaned, she was sent to live with her grandparents on their farm in the 5th century BCE. It was a lonely existence, for her grandfather was a gruff man who seldom had a kind word to say. Her grandmother was a kinder soul, but even she was always busy with the never-ending chores of running the farm. The only bright spot in Rosaline's life was the time she spent in the forest near her home. There, she would often find strange and wonderful creatures, and she would while away the hours dreaming of a life filled with adventure. One day, when she was out in the forest, Rosaline met a fairy. The fairy's name was Ariel, and she told Rosaline that she had been sent to take her away to a land ofmagic and wonders. Without hesitation, Rosaline agreed to go with Ariel, and she was soon whisked away to the kingdom of Mars. There, she met the king and queen, who informed her that she was the long-lost princess of Mars. They told her of a prophecy that said she would one day save the kingdom from a great evil. Rosaline was initially doubtful of this, but she soon found herself caught up in a series of adventures that proved the prophecy was true. With the help of her new friends, she vanquished the evil forces that had been threatening Mars and assumed her rightful place as its queen. Rosaline Mars lived happily ever after and ruled her kingdom with wisdom and kindness. She often thought of her grandparents and the farm on Earth, but her life was now on Mars and she was content.
