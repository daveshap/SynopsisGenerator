BEGINNING:

==========

The story begins in China during a mythic period of history. A young woman named Xinghua is living a peaceful life with her family in a small village. However, she is constantly pestered by a man named Jieyu, who is from a wealthy family and is hoping to marry her. Xinghua is not interested in him, but he will not take no for an answer. One day, Jieyu finally snaps and rapes Xinghua. She is devastated and feels completely violated. She is also worried about what her family will think of her if they find out. Eventually, Xinghua decides to take matters into her own hands and kills Jieyu. She then cuts off his head and leaves it on the doorstep of his family's home. This act of retribution sets off a series of events that leads to Xinghua being forced to flee her village. She ends up in the wilderness, where she is discovered by a group of bandits. They take her in and train her to be a warrior. Xinghua adapts to her new life and becomes a fierce fighter. She also starts to develop feelings for the leader of the bandits, a man named Shen. However, peace does not last long. The village where Xinghua grew up is attacked by a rival clan and Shen is killed in the battle. Xinghua is devastated, but she knows that she must go on. She takes over as the leader of the bandits and leads them on a series of successful raids. She also exacts revenge on the clan that killed Shen. The story ends with Xinghua and her band of followers living happily in the wilderness. They are at peace and have everything they need.
