In an alternative timeline, the middle east is a peaceful place ruled by a sultan. One day, a young woman named Sheikha arrives in the sultan's palace. She is beautiful, and the sultan is immediately attracted to her. MIDDLE: The sultan begins to court Sheikha, and she eventually becomes his wife. However, she is a cold and unemotional woman.

She is unresponsive at first, but eventually she begins to respond to his touch. The sultan is overjoyed, and they spend the night making love. END: In the morning, the sultan and Sheikha are found in the garden by the sultan's advisors. They are both naked, and it is clear that they have been making love.
