BEGINNING:

==========

Oliver is a young biracial boy living in Scandinavia with his mother. His mother is white and his father is black, and he looks very different from both of them. He feels like an outsider in his own family and in his community. When he was younger, he was teased and bullied for his mixed race, but he's learned to ignore the stares and the comments. One day, when he's out walking alone, he sees a group of black men in a car. They motion for him to come over, and he does. They offer him a ride and he gets in. They ask him questions about his life and he answers honestly. They seem interested in him and he feels like he finally belongs somewhere. The men take him to a strange place in the woods and tell him to wait there. He does as he's told and soon falls asleep. When he wakes up, he's surrounded by cult members wearing black robes and chanting. He's confused and scared, and he wants to leave, but he's also curious about what they're doing. The cult leader, a woman named Lilith, comes to speak to him. She tells him about their beliefs and how they worship the devil. She asks him if he wants to join them, and he agrees. He's given a black robe to wear and told to participate in the rituals. He doesn't really understand what's going on, but he goes along with it because he wants to belong. The cult engages in all sorts of dark practices, including animal and human sacrifice. They believe that the more pain and suffering they cause, the more pleased the devil will be. Oliver begins to question what he's doing, and he starts to have doubts about the cult. He starts to feel like he's in over his head. One night, during a particularly gruesome ritual, Oliver can't take it anymore. He runs away from the cult and into the woods. He's pursued by the cult members, but he manages to lose them. He makes his way back home, but he's changed. He's seen things that he can't unsee, and he's done things that he can't undo. He's not the same innocent boy that he was before. MIDDLE: Oliver tries to go back to his old life, but he can't. He's haunted by the memories of what he's seen and done. He has nightmares about the cult and about Lilith. He starts to withdraw from his family and friends. He can't tell them what's going on, because he's ashamed and scared. He doesn't want to be different from them anymore, but he can't help it. He starts to drink heavily and self-harm. He becomes fixated on the cult and on Lilith. He wants to find them and make them pay for what they did to him. However, the longer he obsesses over them, the more he realizes that he can never go back. He's changed too much. He's seen too much. He knows things that he can't un-know. Eventually, he decides to take matters into his own hands and goes back to the cult's compound. He's armed with knives and a gun, and he's ready to kill. When he arrives, he's met with resistance. The cult members are prepared for him and they fight back. He's outnumbered and outmatched, and he's soon captured. Lilith comes to talk to him, and she's not scared or worried at all. She knows that he can't hurt her. She tells him that he's one of them now, and that there's no going back. He's taken to the dungeon and tortured. He's made to watch as the cult members torture and kill others. He's broken mentally and physically, and he can't take it anymore. He asks Lilith to kill him, and she does. END: Oliver's death doesn't free him from the cult. He's haunted by the things that he's seen and done. He's tortured by the memories of the people he's killed and the people he's hurt. He's in a limbo between life and death, and he can't escape. He's stuck in this purgatory, reliving his worst memories over and over again. The only way to find peace is to find Lilith and kill her. He knows that she's the key to his release. He starts to stalk her, and he eventually finds her living in a remote cabin in the woods. He breaks in and stabs her to death. As he's dying, he finally feels at peace. He knows that he's done what he needed to do, and he can
