As he gets older, Cairo starts to get into trouble with the law.

He finds work where he can, but nothing seems to stick. He's not cut out for a life of hard labor. The only thing he's really good at is shooting a gun. One day, Cairo hears about a gang of outlaws who are terrorizing the nearby town of Nefertiti. The gang is led by a ruthless woman named Salma.

Finally, he meets a young woman named Mehmet. Mehmet is one of Salma's victims. She's been under the outlaw's spell for months, and she's desperate to be free.
