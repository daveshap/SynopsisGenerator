BEGINNING:

==========

In the small town of Salmon Bay, subzero temperatures are the norm and darkness descends early in the afternoon. It's a place where people know their neighbors and children play safely in the streets. But one winter, everything changes. One by one, people in Salmon Bay start disappearing. There's no trace of them anywhere - no bodies, no clues. The only thing the police have to go on are the strange, rambling letters that each disappearances leaves behind. As the town spirals into panic, detective Eva Lindstrom is tasked with solving the case. But Eva has her own demons to contend with. She's still haunted by the disappearance of her own sister, many years ago. And the closer she gets to the truth of what happened in Salmon Bay, the more she realizes that this case is personal. MIDDLE: As Eva works to piece together the puzzle of the disappearances, she uncovers a web of secrets and lies that has been hidden in the town for generations. Slowly, she realizes that the key to solving the case lies in uncovering the truth of what happened to her sister all those years ago. But the closer Eva gets to the truth, the more dangerous it becomes. She's now a target, and someone is determined to stop her from finding out the secrets of Salmon Bay - even if it means killing her. Eva is in a race against time to solve the case and save her own life. But the closer she gets to the truth, the more she realizes that her sister's disappearance is just the tip of the iceberg. And the secrets of Salmon Bay are darker than she ever could have imagined. END: Eva finally uncovers the truth of what happened in Salmon Bay. The disappearances were part of a ritualistic killing spree orchestrated by a cult that has been operating in the town for generations. The cult's members are some of the most respected people in Salmon Bay, and they'll stop at nothing to keep their secrets hidden. Eva is able to solve the case, but at a terrible cost. She's been framed for the murders, and now she's a target herself. She's forced to go on the run, and she can never go back to Salmon Bay again. The cult is still out there, and Eva knows that it's only a matter of time before they come for her. She's living in fear, always looking over her shoulder. But she's determined to expose the cult and bring them to justice. This is a suspenseful, psychological thriller with a twisty, fast-paced plot and compelling, fully developed characters.
