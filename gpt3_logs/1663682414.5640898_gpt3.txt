Write a brief one sentence summary of this story:


In 1605, a group of conspirators in England attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament in London in an act of terrorism. The plot was foiled, but the conspirators were never caught. Several years later, one of the conspirators, Guy Fawkes, is arrested and tried for his role in the plot. He is found guilty and executed. In the years that follow, the English public becomes increasingly aware of the existence of conspiracies and begins to suspect that the government is involved in them. This suspicion is fueled by a series of scandals and public revelations that seem to confirm the existence of a government conspiracy. As public suspicion and paranoia grow, a number of conspiracy theories begin to circulate. One of the most popular theories is that the government is working with the Catholic Church to secretly control the country. This theory is given credence when, in 1649, King Charles I is executed by a group of Protestant conspirators. The English Civil War breaks out soon after, and the country is plunged into chaos. In the midst of this chaos, a group of conspirators known as the Rota Club comes to prominence. The Rota Club is a secret society that is dedicated to uncovering and exposing conspiracies. The Rota Club begins to investigate a number of suspect government agencies and officials. They soon uncover evidence of a massive conspiracy that involves the government, the Catholic Church, and a number of other powerful institutions. The Rota Club's investigations eventually lead them to uncover the true extent of the conspiracy: a plot to secretly control the world. The conspirators are using a powerful magical artifact known as the Philosopher's Stone to create a race of super-humans who will be able to contro the world. The Rota Club expose the conspiracy and, in the process, destroy the Philosopher's Stone. This destroys theconspirators' plans and foils their plot. In the aftermath of the exposure, the Rota Club members go their separate ways. Fifteen years later, the world is a much different place. The exposed conspiracy has resulted in a massive public backlash against the government and the Catholic Church. Both institutions are now greatly diminished in power. In the wake of the conspiracy's exposure, a number of new conspiracy theories have begun to circulate. The most popular of these theories is that the government is working with aliens to secretly control the world. This theory is given credence when, in 1664, a strange device is discovered in the ruins of the Tower of London. The device is a powerful alien artifact that allows the user to control the minds of others. The artifact is reverse-engineered and used by the government to create a secret police force that can control the minds of the populace. The existence of the secret police is soon exposed, and the resulting public outcry leads to the disbanding of the force. The government is left weakened and discredited. In the aftermath of the scandal, a number of different groups begin to vie for power. One of these groups is the Order of the Nine Angles, a secret society that is dedicated to promoting chaos and destruction. The Order begins to gain a following, and soon becomes one of the most powerful groups in the country. The Order's ultimate goal is to bring about the destruction of the government and the establishment of a new world order. To this end, they begin to plot a series of terrorist attacks. The most significant of these is the 1666 Great Fire of London. The fire destroys a large portion of the city, and the resulting public outcry leads to the downfall of the government. The Order of the Nine Angles takes power, and begins to implement their plans for a new world order. However, the Order's plans are soon exposed, and they are forced to flee the country. The exposure of the Order's plot leaves the world in a state of chaos, and sets the stage for a new round of conspiracy theories and paranoia. In the years that follow, the world descends into a state of anarchy. A number of different groups vie for power, and the world is plunged into a series of bloody wars. In the midst of this chaos, a new group calling itself the Illuminati begins to rise to prominence. The Illuminati is a secret society that is dedicated to secretly controlling the world. To this end, they begin to plot a series of terrorist attacks. The most significant of these is the 1683 attack on the city of London. The attack destroys a large portion of the city, and the resulting public outcry leads to the downfall of the government. The Illuminati takes power, and begins to implement their plans for a new world order. However, the Illuminati's plans are soon exposed, and they are forced to flee the country. The exposure of the Illuminati's plot leaves the world in a state of chaos, and sets the stage for a new round of conspiracy theories and paranoia.
