BEGINNING:

==========

A large, old estate in England is the primary setting for this gothic fiction story with a unique twist. The estate is in a state of disrepair and has been uninhabited for many years. The protagonist, an eccentric old woman, lives in the estate and is the only character in the story. The woman is a recluse who rarely leaves her home and spends her days tending to her garden. She is a eccentric old woman who talks to herself and is often seen by the townspeople as crazy. One day, a group of teens from the town decide to explore the estate. They are quickly scared off by the old woman. However, one of the teens, a teenage girl named Sarah, is intrigued by the woman and decides to return to the estate. Sarah begins to visit the old woman regularly and the two form a unlikely friendship. As Sarah spends more time at the estate, she discovers that the woman is not crazy but is actually very intelligent and well-educated. The woman begins to tells Sarah stories about her life and the estate. The stories are incredibly fascinating and Sarah finds herself enthralled by them. Eventually, Sarah learns that the woman is actually a witch and that the estate is under a curse. The witch tells Sarah that the only way to break the curse is to find a magical object that is hidden somewhere on the estate. Sarah is skeptical but is willing to help the woman break the curse. The two begin to search for the object and eventually find it. With the curse now broken, the woman is finally able to leave the estate and rejoin society. The story ends with the two women living happily ever after.
