BEGINNING:

==========

In the 16th century, a young woman named Kim Yoon-hee is living in Korea. She is an orphan, and has been sold into servitude by her cruel uncle. Yoon-hee is shy and awkward, and she feels out of place in the bustling household where she works. One day, while Yoon-hee is out running errands, she is attacked by a group of men. They drag her into an alleyway and begin to assault her. Yoon-hee is terrified, and believes that she is going to die. Suddenly, a strange man appears and fought off her attackers. He tells Yoon-hee not to be afraid, and she is instantly drawn to him. The man introduces himself as Joon-woo, a warrior who has been cursed with immortality. He says that he has been watching over Yoon-hee, and has been waiting for the right moment to save her. Joon-woo tells Yoon-hee that he is part of a secret society of immortals known as the Guardians. He says that she has been chosen to be the latest addition to their ranks. Yoon-hee is hesitant at first, but she eventually agrees to join the Guardians. As Yoon-hee begins her training, she quickly discovers that she has a natural affinity for combat. She also develops feelings for Joon-woo, but is unsure if he reciprocates her feelings. However, she is soon faced with a difficult decision when she learns that the Guardians are planning to kill a powerful politician who is corrupt. Yoon-hee knows that the politician is evil, but she also knows that killing him will make her just as culpable in his crimes. She agonizes over what to do, but ultimately decides to kill the politician herself. She knows that it is the right thing to do, even though she knows that she will be branded a murderer. ENDING: Yoon-hee is successful in killing the politician, but she is also wounded in the process. Joon-woo finds her and brings her back to the Guardians' hideout. As Yoon-hee lays dying, she tells Joon-woo that she loves him. Joon-woo is heartbroken, but he knows that he must let Yoon-hee go. He watches as she dies in his arms, and then sets out to find the person who cursed him with immortality. He knows that he can never truly be happy until he lifts the curse, even if it means giving up his own life.
