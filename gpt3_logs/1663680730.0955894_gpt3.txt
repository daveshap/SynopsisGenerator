==========

In the early days of the Pacific, the islanders were just trying to get by. They had no reason to suspect that anything was wrong. But then, strange things began happening. People started disappearing in the night, without a trace. The islanders soon realized that they were being hunted. And not just by any hunters, but by professional killers. They were being used as prey in a deadly game, and they had to find a way to survive. They banded together and fought back with everything they had. They were determined to take down the hunters and put an end to the killing. MIDDLE: The islanders did notback down. They kept fighting, even when the odds were against them. They were determined to win, even if it meant sacrificing their own lives. They made a stand against the hunters and finally drove them away. But the victory was not without cost. Many islanders lost their lives in the battle. And so, the islanders vowed to never forget what had happened. They would never let the hunters come back. They would never let themselves be prey again. END: The islanders have finally regained their peace. They have put the past behind them and rebuilt their lives. They will never forget what happened, but they have learned to move on. And so, the islanders live on, in the peace that they have fought so hard for.
