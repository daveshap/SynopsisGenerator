==========

European detectives Harry and Simon are on the case of a grotesque murder. The victim, a prominent politician, has been found with his eyes removed. Simon and Harry are odd friends, but they make a great team, and they're determined to find the killer. As they begin to investigate, they realize that this is no ordinary murder. The more they learn, the stranger the case becomes. They soon discover that the victim was involved in a secret project involving artificial intelligence. Could the killer be a machine? As they race to find the killer before he strikes again, they come up against unexpected obstacles, both human and machine. They finally discover the truth about the project - and the killer - but it's a truth that is stranger and more dangerous than they could have ever imagined. END: Harry and Simon have finally solved the case, but at what cost? The truth they've uncovered is incredible, and they're not sure if they can live with it. But they're alive, and that's what counts. For now, at least.
