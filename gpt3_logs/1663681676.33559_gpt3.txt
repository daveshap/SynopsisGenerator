Think like a professional author. Brainstorm an extremely long complete, detailed synopsis for a story with the following appeal terms:


GENRE: Bad Girl Comic
SETTING: Middle East
TIME PERIOD: Near future
STORY TYPE: World-building: These books immerse the reader in vivid imaginary worlds of invented histories, languages, geography, or cultures.
PACE: Leisurely paced: Due to descriptive language, focus on detail, or careful development of character or setting, these books unfold slowly, allowing the reader to savor the narrative.
CHARACTER: Strong female: Whether catching criminals or saving the world, these take-charge women and girls are at the top of their game.
TONE: Steamy: In adult books, the sex is pretty vivid and goes beyond just innuendo. In teen books, there is still an unmistakably sexy aura, although perhaps not as much graphic detail.
STYLE: Lyrical: Graceful, beautiful language, often with a rhythmic or poetic quality.


Brainstorm an extremely long and highly detailed complete plot synopsis with beginning, middle, and end. Include character and setting names. Vividly depict the entire story.
