It is 2nd century BCE in Scandinavia. In a small village, two friends, Lars and Erik, are out exploring the woods when they come across a strange stone structure. They decide to go inside and have a look around. Inside, they find a strange room with a large stone table in the center. On the table is a handwritten book. They begin to read it, and quickly realize that it is a journal written by a man named Arne. As they read, they learn that Arne was an explorer who had discovered the stone structure by accident. He had been looking for a lost city that was mentioned in an ancient text. In the journal, Arne describes his journey to find the city and what he found there. Lars and Erik are fascinated by the story and decide to try to find the city themselves. They spend the next few months planning their trip and gathering supplies. Finally, they set off on their journey. They have many adventures along the way, and eventually find the lost city. It is everything Arne had described and more. As they explore the city, they realize that they are not the only ones there. They meet a group of people who have been living in the city for generations. The group is led by a woman named Inga. Inga tells them that the city is a place where time doesn't work the same way as it does in the outside world. She and her people are able to time travel, and they have been using this power to help people in the outside world. Lars and Erik are amazed by all of this, and they decide to stay in the city and help Inga and her people. They spend the next few years living in the city and helping Inga with her work. As time goes on, Lars and Erik become more and more comfortable with their new life in the city. They make new friends and learn more about the city and its history. One day, Inga asks them to help her with a special project. She wants to go back in time to the 2nd century BCE and help a group of people who are facing a great danger. Lars and Erik agree to help, and they travel back in time with Inga. They find the group of people and help them to safety. After they return to the present, Inga tells them that the people they helped were the ancestors of Lars and Erik. She also tells them that the city is in danger. A group of people from the outside world has found out about the city and its time-traveling abilities. They want to use the city to change the course of history. Lars and Erik agree to help Inga stop the group. They travel back in time again and again, thwarting the group's plans. Finally, they are able to stop the group and save the city. Inga thanks them for their help and tells them that they are always welcome in the city. Lars and Erik return to the present and resume their normal lives. They continue to visit the city from time to time, and they stay in touch with their friends there. The city remains a secret, known only to a few people. It remains a safe haven for those who need it, and a place where time can be bent to help those in need.
