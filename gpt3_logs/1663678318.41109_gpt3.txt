BEGINNING:

==========

The story begins in New Zealand in the 3rd century BCE. The protagonist, a young woman named Mara, is living a happy and peaceful life with her family and friends. However, her world is turned upside down when her village is attacked by a rival tribe. Many of her loved ones are killed in the massacre, and Mara is left for dead. Leading up to the attack, there had been increasing tension between the two tribes, which Mara had noticed but tried to ignore. She now realizes that she should have paid more attention to the warning signs and maybe could have prevented the tragedy. The first part of the story focuses on Mara's recovery from her injuries and her grieving process. She is nursed back to health by a woman from the rival tribe who shows her kindness and compassion. Mara is filled with rage and hatred towards her own people and she starts to plot her revenge. MIDDLE: Mara's opportunity for revenge comes when she is asked to join a raid on the rival tribe's village. She readily agrees, and the raid is a success. Many people are killed, including the woman who nursed Mara back to health. Mara feels triumphant at first, but the victory is short-lived. She quickly realizes that the cycle of violence is never-ending. Her own people are now the ones living in fear, and she knows that it is only a matter of time before the rival tribe strikes back. As the tension between the two tribes escalates, Mara finds herself caught in the middle. She is torn between her loyalty to her own people and her growing sympathy for the rival tribe. She knows that she can't keep living like this and she has to make a choice. END: Mara's decision is to leave her village and go live with the rival tribe. It is a difficult decision, but she knows it is the right thing to do. She hopes that by living among them, she can help to heal the wounds of the past and prevent further violence. The story ends with Mara starting her new life with the rival tribe. She is hopeful for the future, but she knows that the road to peace will be long and difficult.
