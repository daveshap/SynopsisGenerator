Write a brief one sentence summary of this story:


In the year 250 AD, a small tribe of cannibals living in the Brazilian rainforest encounters a group of explorers from Europe. The two groups clash, and the Europeans are all killed. The cannibals then eat the explorers, using their bodies to sustain themselves. For the next few hundred years, the cannibals continue to thrive in the rainforest, living off of the land and occasional victims that they manage to capture. They grow in number and eventually establish a village, where they live a relatively peaceful life. In the year 1550, the village is discovered by a group of Spanish missionaries. At first, the cannibals are friendly towards the newcomers, but relations eventually sour as the Spaniards attempt to convert them to Christianity. A bloody conflict ensues, and the Spaniards are driven out. For the next few hundred years, the cannibals remain undisturbed in their rainforest village. However, in the late 1800s, they are discovered once again by outsiders  this time, a group of scientists from Europe. The scientists are fascinated by the cannibals and their way of life, and they spend several years studying them. BUT THEN, things take a turn for the worse when the scientists begin to experiment on the cannibals, and many of them are killed in the process. Outraged, the cannibals lash out and kill all of the scientists. With the outside world now aware of their existence, the cannibals know that they will not be left alone for long. And sure enough, soon afterwards, a group of soldiers arrives, intent on wiping out the cannibals. In a brutal battle, the soldiers are successful in killing many of the cannibals. But the remaining survivors are able to flee into the depths of the rainforest, where they remain hidden for the next few decades. In the present day, the cannibals are still living in the rainforest, staying hidden from the outside world. But as their numbers continue to dwindle, they know that they must find new victims to slaughter and eat in order to survive. And so, they begin to hunt for humans once again The cannibals spend the next few years stalking and murdering people who venture into the rainforest. Some of their victims are lost tourists, while others are scientists or soldiers who have come looking for them. But no matter who their victims are, the cannibals show no mercy, slaughtering them and eating their flesh. As the years go by, the cannibals become more and more brazen in their killings. They even start to venture out of the rainforest and into populated areas, where they kidnap people and take them back to their village to be killed. This reign of terror eventually catches the attention of the government, and they send in a team of special forces to deal with the cannibals. But the cannibals are ready for them, and they ambush the team, killing them all. With the government now taking a more serious interest in their activities, the cannibals know that they must be more careful. But they are still hungry, and they continue to kill and eat anyone who gets in their way. eventually, the cannibals are cornered by the military in their rainforest village. outnumbered and outgunned, the cannibals know that they cannot win. And so, they make a desperate last stand, attacking the military with whatever they have. But in the end, they are all killed, and the rainforest is finally rid of their presence. Or so it seems A few years later, a group of hikers stumbles upon the remains of the cannibals village. And as they explore, they realize that the cannibals may not be gone after all. Deep in the rainforest, the cannibals are still hiding, waiting for the right moment to strike again. And as the hikers venture deeper into the forest, they realize too late that they are not alone. The cannibals attack, slaughtering the hikers and eating their flesh. And with their new victims, they are ready to start their reign of terror once again.
