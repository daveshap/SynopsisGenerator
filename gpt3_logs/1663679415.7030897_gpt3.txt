BEGINNING:

==========

Captain David Wilburn was on his way home from his latest tour of duty in the Mediterranean when he and his crew were suddenly set upon by a small fleet of unknown spacecraft. The attack was fierce and overwhelming, and soon the captain and his men were left with no choice but to abandon ship. They were able to make it to a small planet in the nearby system, but they were soon captured by the aliens who had destroyed their ship. The aliens, it turns out, are a race of large, intelligent reptiles who are engaged in a war with the humans. The captain and his men are taken prisoner and are put to work in the aliens' mines. The conditions are harsh, but the captain and his men refuse to give up hope. They know that someday they will find a way to escape and return to Earth to warn the other humans of the impending threat. MIDDLE: The years pass, and the captain and his men are finally able to escape from the aliens' prison. They make their way back to Earth, but they find that the planet has been all but overrun by the reptiles. The humans are fighting a losing battle, and the captain knows that he has to do something to turn the tide. He gathers together a group of the most skilled military personnel and leads them on a series of daring raids against the reptilian forces. Using their knowledge of the enemy's weaknesses, they are able to score some significant victories. But the humans are still outnumbered and outgunned, and the captain knows that it is only a matter of time before the reptiles win the war. END: The final battle between the humans and the reptiles is fought on the surface of the sun. The humans are able to harness the sun's energy and use it to destroy the reptilian fleet. With their enemies defeated, the humans are finally able to reclaim Earth and rebuild their civilization. The captain and his men are hailed as heroes, and they live to see the day when humans and reptiles can live in peace.
