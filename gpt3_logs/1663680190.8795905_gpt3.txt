BEGINNING:

==========

It's Christmastime, and Commander Laura Rogers is on a space mission with her lgtbqia+ crew. They're orbiting Earth, observing the holiday festivities down below. The crew is homesick and missing their families, but they're also excited to be on such an important mission. Christmas day arrives, and the crew gathers around the view screen to watch the celebrations happening on Earth. They see people singing carols, exchanging gifts, and spending time with their loved ones. They also see people who are alone, struggling with mental illness, or experiencing other forms of hardship. The crew is moved by what they see and decide to use their own transmitting equipment to send holiday messages of hope and love to people on Earth. They spend the rest of the day and night sending messages, and they feel like they've made a difference. Eventually, it's time for the crew to head back to Earth. They say goodbye to the beautiful stars and planets they've been observing and head home, knowing that they're lucky to have each other. END: The crew arrives back on Earth and is greeted by their families. They're happy to be home, but they're also proud of the work they've done. They know that they've made a difference in the world, and they'll never forget the holiday they spent in orbit.
