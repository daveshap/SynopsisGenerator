BEGINNING:

==========

It is the 1st century in England and the country is poised on the brink of great change. The Roman Empire is beginning to crumble and, with it, the old ways of life are fading. Into this volatile mix comes our protagonist, an awkward young man who is desperately trying to find his place in the world. He is an outsider, both by virtue of his heritage and by his lack of social skills. He clumsy, naive, and often says the wrong thing. But he is also kind-hearted and good-natured, with a deep love for his family and friends. As the country is plunged into upheaval, our protagonist must find the strength to navigate the new world. He will make mistakes, but he will also learn and grow. Along the way, he will discover the true meaning of friendship, family, and home. MIDDLE: The story progresses through a series of fast-paced events, as our protagonist tries to find his place in the rapidly changing world around him. At times, he is successful; at others, he falls flat on his face. But he always gets back up again and continues to try. At the heart of the story is his relationship with his friends and family. They are the people who know him best and who love him unconditionally, even when he makes a mess of things. They are his anchor in the stormy sea of life. Throughout the story, there are moments of hope and optimism, which express the belief that, no matter how dark things may seem, they can always get better. END: The story comes to a conclusion with our protagonist having learned some important lessons. He is now a young man who is more sure of himself and his place in the world. He has found the strength to overcome adversity and the courage to stand up for what he believes in. This is a story of hope, of friendship, of family, and of finding one's way in the world. It is a story that celebrates the awkward, the clumsy, and the na√Øve. It is a story for anyone who has ever felt like an outsider.
