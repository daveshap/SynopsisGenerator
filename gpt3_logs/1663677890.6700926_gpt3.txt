BEGINNING:

==========

It is the early twentieth century and France is a country in turmoil. The feudal system is under attack by modernity and the idea of romantic love is beginning to take hold. In the midst of this, a young nobleman named Etienne de Gaulle finds himself torn between duty to his family and his own yearnings for something more. Etienne's father, Marquis de Gaulle, is a wealthy and powerful man who expects his son to follow in his footsteps and take up the family business. However, Etienne is more interested in art and literature, and feels stifled by the expectations placed on him. He is especially intrigued by the new concept of chivalric romance, which promotes the ideal of courtly love. Etienne longs to find a woman who embodies this ideal, and he finally seems to find her in the form of Gabrielle Duchemin. Gabrielle is a beautiful and intelligent young woman who comes from a humble background. She is also deeply committed to the chivalric ideal, and Etienne is immediately drawn to her. However, their relationship is not easy. Etienne's father is strongly opposed to it, and Gabrielle's social status makes her a target of scorn from Etienne's snobbish friends and family. Nevertheless, the two of them continue to grow closer, drawn together by their shared passion for chivalric romance. MIDDLE: As their relationship deepens, Etienne and Gabrielle begin to explore the more physical aspects of love. They are often forced to clandestine meetings, as Marquis de Gaulle does not approve of their relationship. However, they are content in each other's company and their love only grows stronger. However, tragedy strikes when Marquis de Gaulle unexpectedly passes away. Etienne is devastated, but he is also now free to pursue his relationship with Gabrielle openly. The two of them get married and start a family of their own. However, Etienne is still haunted by his father's disapproval, and he starts to doubt whether he is truly worthy of Gabrielle's love. These doubts eventually take their toll on their relationship, and Etienne and Gabrielle begin to grow apart. END: Etienne's doubts about his relationship with Gabrielle reach a breaking point when she is tragically killed in a car accident. This destroys him emotionally, and he falls into a deep depression. He is only pulled out of it by his young son, who reminds him of the happiness he once shared with Gabrielle. Etienne slowly begins to rebuild his life, and he eventually remarries. However, he never forgets Gabrielle and the intense love they shared. He continues to cherish her memory, and the chivalric ideal that she represented, for the rest of his life.
