BEGINNING:

==========

Once upon a time, in another galaxy far, far away, there was an ancient kingdom that was plagued by a very serious problem. The people of this kingdom were constantly at war with each other, and no one could seem to find a way to stop the fighting. One day, a wise king decided that he would try to find a way to solve the problem. He went to a hermit who lived in the forest and asked for his advice. The hermit told the king that the only way to stop the fighting was to find a magical stone that had the power to make people stop fighting. The king was skeptical, but he decided to try to find the stone. He searched everywhere, but he couldn't find it. Finally, he went to a wizard and asked for his help. The wizard told the king that the stone was inside a volcano that was about to erupt. The king went to the volcano and found the stone just as the eruption began. He took the stone and ran as fast as he could. When he got back to his kingdom, he placed the stone in the middle of the town square and announced that anyone who touched the stone would be permanently pacified. For a while, it worked. The people of the kingdom stopped fighting and lived in peace. But then, one day, a young boy found the stone and picked it up. He didn't know what it did, and he didn't know that he shouldn't touch it. As soon as he did, he started to feel a terrible pain in his head. The pain was so bad that he went into a coma. MIDDLE: News of the boy's condition spread quickly throughout the kingdom, and everyone began to worry. The boy's parents were distraught and didn't know what to do. The king was greatly troubled by what had happened and felt responsible. He went to the wizard and asked for his help. The wizard told the king that the only way to save the boy's life was to find another magical stone that could counteract the effects of the first stone. The king didn't know where to find such a stone, but the wizard said that he would help him search. After a long and difficult journey, they finally found the stone. The king took it back to his kingdom and placed it next to the first stone. As soon as he did, the boy woke up from his coma and was completely cured. END: The people of the kingdom were amazed and grateful. The king was hailed as a hero, and the young boy became a symbol of hope for the future. The kingdom prospered and lived in peace for many years.
