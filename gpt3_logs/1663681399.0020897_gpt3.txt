Think like a professional author. Brainstorm an extremely long complete, detailed synopsis for a story with the following appeal terms:


GENRE: Mystery Literature
SETTING: Japan
TIME PERIOD: 1st century
STORY TYPE: Open-ended: Instead of providing answers, these books invite readers to ponder events long after the last page.
PACE: Leisurely paced: Due to descriptive language, focus on detail, or careful development of character or setting, these books unfold slowly, allowing the reader to savor the narrative.
CHARACTER: Twisted: Deviant and often unsettling, these characters push the boundaries of literature through behavior that ranges from disturbing to illegal.
TONE: Steamy: In adult books, the sex is pretty vivid and goes beyond just innuendo. In teen books, there is still an unmistakably sexy aura, although perhaps not as much graphic detail.
STYLE: Witty: These cleverly written books use language in an inventive, humorous way.


Brainstorm an extremely long and highly detailed complete plot synopsis with beginning, middle, and end. Include character and setting names. Vividly depict the entire story.
