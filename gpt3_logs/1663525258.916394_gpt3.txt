EDITOR FEEDBACK: 1. Though this is a synopsis, there's a lot of tell and not enough show. To make this more compelling, try to focus on specific scenes and moments rather than broad overviews. 2. The beginning feels a bit contrived - two people who meet by chance and instantly feel drawn to each other. If you can make this meeting more organic and believable, it will help the rest of the story. 3. The middle section of the story is the most interesting, but it would benefit from more tension and conflict. What specific challenges do the two lovers face, and how do they overcome them? 4. The ending feels tidy and fairy-tale like. How can you make it more realistic and believable? 5. Overall, this story could be more original and nuanced. What specific elements can you add to make it stand out from other stories in this genre?
