==========

Hui Shan is a young woman living in China during the Middle Renaissance. She is part of the intellectual elite and is known for her sharp wit and banter-filled dialogue. Her life is turned upside down when she starts seeing strange things happening around her. People and objects appear and disappear without explanation. Hui Shan is convinced that she is going crazy. In an effort to get to the bottom of what is happening, Hui Shan enlists the help of her friend Li Wei, a well-respected scholar. Together, they begin to investigate these strange occurrences. They soon discover that they are not the only ones experiencing these bizarre phenomena. As they delve deeper into the mystery, Hui Shan and Li Wei come to believe that these events are connected to a much larger conspiracy. They realize that they are in danger and must solve the mystery before it is too late. MIDDLE: Hui Shan and Li Wei's investigation takes them all over China. They speak with hundreds of people who have all experienced similar occurrences. They also discover that many of these people have mysteriously disappeared. Hui Shan and Li Wei are convinced that there is a link between these strange events and the disappearances. They believe that someone is kidnapping people who have witnessed these bizarre phenomena. They narrow down their suspect list to two possible culprits: an evil spirits and a group of rogue government officials. They race against the clock to find evidence to support their theory. END: Hui Shan and Li Wei's investigation leads them to a secret government laboratory. They discover that the government officials are experimenting with extradimensional travel. They have been using human subjects in their experiments and that is why people have been disappearing. Hui Shan and Li Wei are able to stop the experiments and rescue the human subjects. They expose the government officials and prevent them from doing any more harm. In the process, they also solve the mystery of the strange occurrences.
