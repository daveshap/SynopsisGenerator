==========

Planet X is a small, rocky world orbiting a dying star in the far reaches of the galaxy. For generations, the planet has been inhabited by a peaceful, intelligent race of aliens. But now, their world is under attack by a ruthless enemy from another world. The aliens have no weapons that can defend themselves against the overwhelming onslaught. Their only hope is to evacuate their planet before it is completely annihilated. But the enemy is not content to just kill the aliens. They want to capture and torture them first. The aliens must use all their ingenuity and courage to escape their doomed world. But even if they succeed, they may never be able to find a new home. MIDDLE: The aliens begin their desperate journey across the hostile planet. Their path is fraught with danger, and they must overcome many obstacles. At times, they are forced to take shelter from the enemy's attacks. But they always keep moving forward, towards the hope of finding safety. As they journey, the aliens come to understand the true nature of their enemy. They are a race of sadistic warriors who take pleasure in bloodshed and mayhem. The aliens also realize that they are not the only ones who are being hunted by the enemy. There are other races out there, also fleeing from the enemy's onslaught. The aliens must band together with these other races if they are to have any hope of surviving. END: The aliens and their allies finally reach a safe haven. But their enemies are not far behind. A final, desperate battle ensues. The aliens and their allies are outnumbered and outgunned, but they fight with all their courage and strength. In the end, the aliens and their allies are victorious. But their world is gone, and their race is nearly extinct. The survivors must now rebuild their lives on a new world.
