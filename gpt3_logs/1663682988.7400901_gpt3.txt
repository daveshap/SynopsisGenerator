The research vessel has been studying the planet below for months, and has made a startling discovery. The planet is home to a valuable mineral that could be used to create a powerful new energy source. However, the research vessel is low on fuel and supplies, and the captain of the warship is determined to seize the mineral for himself. As the research vessel prepares to land on the planet, the warship moves in to attack.
