It is the year 250 AD, and the Roman Empire is at its height. The world is a dangerous place, and the Middle East is no exception. But in the city of Petra, one man seems to have it all: wealth, power, and a beautiful wife. His name is Cassius, and he is the governor of the province. But all is not as it seems. Cassius is a deeply conflicted man, haunted by his past and struggling to keep up the faade of happiness. His wife, Senora, is cold and distant, more interested in her own status than in her husband. And the people of Petra are increasingly resentful of their Roman masters. As Cassius's grip on his sanity begins to slip, the stage is set for a psychological horror story that will keep readers on the edge of their seats. As the story progresses, the cracks in Cassius's faade become more and more apparent. He is increasingly paranoid, seeing threats everywhere. He becomes obsessed with a rumor that Senora is having an affair, and he begins to spy on her. Meanwhile, the people of Petra are growing more and more restless. There are rumors of a rebellion brewing, and Cassius's grip on the city is beginning to slip. The tension comes to a head when Cassius's paranoia leads him to believe that Senora is plotting against him. He confronts her, and in a moment of madness, he kills her. With his wife dead and the people of Petra rising up against him, Cassius's world is crumbling.
