Sometimes he wishes he could just disappear. As he walks to school, he notices a strange black cloud in the sky. It's getting closer and closer, and soon it envelopes the entire planet. John can't see anything, and he feels like he's suffocating. Suddenly, he's transported to a different time and place. He finds himself in a dark forest, and it's eerily quiet. He's not sure where he is or how he got there. As he tries to find his way out, he hears a noise in the distance. It sounds like someone is crying. He follows the noise and comes to a clearing where he sees a young girl sitting on the ground, crying. He approaches her and asks her what's wrong. She tells him that her name is Alice and she's lost. John offers to help her find her way home, and she takes his hand. They begin to walk through the forest, but it's getting darker and darker. Alice is getting more and more scared, and she clings to John's hand. Suddenly, they see a light in the distance. They follow it and find themselves at the edge of a cliff.
