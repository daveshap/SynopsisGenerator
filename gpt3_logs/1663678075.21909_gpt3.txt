BEGINNING:

==========

The movie opens with aaelfaa WWI dogfight in the skies above the North Atlantic. We are introduced to our protagonist, Hauke, a young German fighter pilot. Hauke is a skilled pilot, but he is also cocky and snarky. He likes to play practical jokes on his fellow pilots and is always ready with a sarcastic quip. Hauke's squadron is pitted against a British squadron led by the legendary fighter pilot, John Bull. Bull is a fierce competitor and an excellent pilot. He immediately takes Hauke's measure and knows that he is going to be a tough adversary. The two squadrons square off against each other in a series of epic dogfights. The action is intense and thrilling. The stakes are high as both sides battle for supremacy of the skies. In the heat of battle, Hauke's plane is shot down and he is forced to bail out. He parachutes into the cold waters of the North Atlantic. Hauke is a strong swimmer, but he is quickly losing strength. He is about to give up hope when he is suddenly rescued by a passing British ship. MIDDLE: Hauke is taken prisoner by the British and is brought to a detention camp. He is placed in a cell with John Bull. At first, the two men are hostile towards each other. But over time, they begin to respect each other's skills as pilots. They also discover that they have a lot in common. They both love to fly and they both have a deep respect for the brotherhood of pilots. As the days go by, the two men grow closer. They form a strong bond and become friends. But their friendship is put to the test when they are taken out of their cell and put on trial for their involvement in the war. The trial is a farce. The evidence against Hauke and John is flimsy at best. But the two men are found guilty and sentenced to death. They are placed in a cell to await their execution. But Hauke is not ready to give up. He comes up with a daring escape plan. He and John Bull make a break for it and escape from the prison. They steal a plane and make their way back to the Front. They rejoined their respective squadrons and continue to fight the good fight. END: The war finally comes to an end. Hauke and John Bull meet one last time on the field of battle. They exchange salute and say goodbye. Hauke returns to Germany and John Bull returns to England. But their friendship has been forged in the heat of battle and will last forever.
