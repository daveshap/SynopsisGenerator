BEGINNING:

==========

It is the year 20xx, and Europe is in a state of turmoil. Economic recession has hit hard, and crime is on the rise. In the midst of this, a new breed of gangster has emerged. These gangsters are clever, entrepreneurial, and most of all, ruthlessly effective. They have quickly gained control of the criminal underworld, and their influence is felt throughout the continent. The story follows Bruno, a young man from a small town in Italy who falls in with the wrong crowd and is drawn into the world of gangsterism. He quickly rises through the ranks, making a name for himself as one of the most ruthless and feared gangsters in Europe. But as he gains power, he also attracts the attention of the authorities. And as the heat intensifies, Bruno must choose between the life of crime that he has come to love and the safety of those he cares about. MIDDLE: Bruno is now one of the most powerful gangsters in Europe, and his criminal empire is growing. But with this success comes greater danger. The authorities are closing in, and Bruno is becoming increasingly paranoid. He knows that it is only a matter of time before they catch up to him. To protect himself and his empire, Bruno makes a deal with the devil. He allies himself with a powerful and ruthless Russian gangster, who has connections with the Russian mafia. This alliance gives Bruno the protection he needs, but it also comes at a price. He must do the Russian gangster's bidding, no matter how brutal or horrific. And so, Bruno is drawn deeper into the criminal underworld, becoming more and more corrupted in the process. He loses his humanity, and his soul becomes blackened. But even as he descends into darkness, he cannot escape the inevitable consequences of his choices. END: Bruno's story ends where it began, in his small hometown in Italy. But he is no longer the same naive young man who fell in with the wrong crowd. He is now a hardened, ruthless gangster, wanted by the authorities all over Europe. He has finally been cornered, and he knows that there is no escape. He could surrender and go to prison, or he could go down fighting. He chooses the latter, and in a spectacular shootout, he takes out dozens of police officers before finally being gunned down himself. As he lies dying in the street, he sees the ghosts of all the people he has killed. They haunt him, and he realizes too late that the price of power has been his soul.
