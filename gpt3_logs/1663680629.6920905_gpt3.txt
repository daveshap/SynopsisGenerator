BEGINNING:

==========

In the not too distant future, the Mediterranean is a hotbed of political tension. Several countries have built huge walls to keep out refugees, and the International Space Agency has set up a base on a small island to keep an eye on things. But when a massive earthquake hits the region, the base is destroyed and the walls come crashing down. As refugees pour into the countries, the already unstable situation quickly spirals out of control. Riots break out, and disease and hunger begin to take their toll. The governments of the world are struggling to cope, and it falls to the people to try to find a way to survive. MAIN STORY: The story follows a group of survivors as they try to make their way in the aftermath of the disaster. They must contend with desperate refugees, hostile governments, and the ever-present danger of disease and starvation. But as they journey across the Mediterranean, they slowly begin to piece together a plan that just might give them a chance at survival. ENDING: The story ends with the group of survivors arriving at their destination, a small island that has been left relatively untouched by the disaster. Here they begin to build a new life, one that is based on cooperation and hope rather than fear and violence. As they look to the future, they know that the world will never be the same again, but they are determined to make it a better place.
