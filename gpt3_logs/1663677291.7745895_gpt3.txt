Brainstorm an extremely long complete, detailed synopsis for a story with the following appeal terms:


GENRE: Horror Films
SETTING: Mars
TIME PERIOD: Iron age
STORY TYPE: Unconventional: Using unique or unexpected elements, these books may twist, adapt, or play with conventional storylines.
PACE: Leisurely paced: Due to descriptive language, focus on detail, or careful development of character or setting, these books unfold slowly, allowing the reader to savor the narrative.
CHARACTER: Sassy: These books feature characters (usually women) with outsized personalities and a bottomless well of one-liners and comebacks.
TONE: Steamy: In adult books, the sex is pretty vivid and goes beyond just innuendo. In teen books, there is still an unmistakably sexy aura, although perhaps not as much graphic detail.
STYLE: Descriptive: Full of elaborate descriptions, with illustrative, expressive language.


Extremely long and highly detailed complete plot synopsis with beginning, middle, and end.

BEGINNING:

==========

Jenna and her friends, Tracey and Nick, are on a Mars expedition, studying the iron age rocks and terrain. They're using state of the art equipment, and they're the first humans to walk on the Martian surface in over a thousand years. But their happy exploration is cut short when they come across a cave with ancient writing on the walls. The writing is in a language they don't recognize, and it seems to be warning them of some sort of danger. They ignore the warning and go deeper into the cave, and that's when they find the skeleton of a huge, three-headed creature. It's clear that whatever this creature was, it was not human. MIDDLE: As they try to make sense of what they're seeing, they hear a noise coming from deeper in the cave. They shine their lights in that direction and see a group of aliens, coming towards them. The aliens are armed with strange weapons, and they're clearly not happy to see the humans. Jenna and her friends try to run, but they're quickly surrounded and captured. The aliens take them to their ship, and Jenna is horrified to see that they're being held in a huge cage with other humans. They're all naked and seem to be in a state of shock, and Jenna soon realizes that they're being experimented on. The aliens are doing something to the humans that is turning them into monsters, and Jenna and her friends are next. END: Jenna and her friends manage to escape, and they make it back to Earth. But they're not the same as they were before. The experience has changed them, and they're now faced with the task of trying to warn the rest of humanity of the aliens' plans. But no one will believe them, and they're soon branded as insane. The aliens are coming, and there's no one who can stop them. Jenna and her friends are the only ones who know the truth, and they're all that stands between humanity and extinction.
