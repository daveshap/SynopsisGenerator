In the small fishing village of Juaquin, life is hard. The villagers eke out a living from the sea, but they are always at the mercy of the elements. And lately, things have been especially tough. The catch has been poor, and there have been rumors of a giant sea monster lurking in the deep waters offshore. One night, while the villagers are gathered around the fire sharing stories, a strange creature rises from the sea and comes ashore. At first they think it is the monster they have been hearing about, but soon they realize that it is something even stranger. The creature is a beautiful woman, draped in seaweed and with strange markings on her skin. She does not speak their language, but she seems to understand them. The villagers are afraid of her at first, but she does not seem to be harmful. Slowly, over the course of weeks, the woman begins to integrate into village life. She starts working with the fishermen, helping them to haul in their catches. The villagers start to call her Aquamarina. The villagers are fascinated by Aquamarina, but there are some who are afraid of her. They think she is a witch, and that she may be responsible for the poor catches they have been having lately. One night, a group of villagers decide to take matters into their own hands and they capture Aquamarina, tying her up and intending to drown her. The next morning, Aquamarina is brought before the village council. They question her, but she does not speak their language and they cannot understand her. The council decides to banish her from the village. Aquamarina is sad to leave the village, but she knows that it is for the best. She returns to the sea and is soon joined by a pod of dolphins. The dolphins help Aquamarina to navigate the underwater world and she soon discovers a lost city, sunken beneath the waves. The city is beautiful and seems to be inhabited by strange creatures. Aquamarina starts to explore the city, and she soon realizes that it is a magical place. She also meets a handsome prince who lives in the city. The two of them fall in love and start to make plans to leave the city together. But just as they are about to leave, Aquamarina is caught by the city's ruler, a wicked witch. The witch imprisoned Aquamarina and the prince, intending to keep them there forever. But Aquamarina is not giving up that easily. She uses her magic to subdue the witch and escape. Then, she frees the prince and the two of them swim up to the surface, where they share a passionate kiss. Aquamarina and the prince return to the lost city and live there together, ruling over the underwater world. They are happy and in love, and they spend their days exploring the city and making plans for their future. The villagers of Juaquin never see Aquamarina again, but they remember her fondly. And from then on, the catches are always good and there is never any more talk of monsters in the sea.
