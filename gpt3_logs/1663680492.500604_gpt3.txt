BEGINNING:

==========

In a small village in New Zealand, the outcaste Fiona and her partner Eleanor are raising their daughter, Aria. Fiona is a skilled healer and uses her knowledge of herbs and potions to help her neighbors, even though she is not always accepted. One day, a stranger comes to the village, sick with a strange ailment. Fiona is able to help him, and he tells her about a land far away where people are living in a utopia, free from sickness and poverty. He asks Fiona if she would like to join them, and she agrees. MIDDLE: Fiona, Eleanor, and Aria travel to the utopia, which is called Eden. They are welcomed by the community and soon settle into their new life. However, Fiona soon realizes that something is not quite right in Eden. The people here seem to be living in a bubble, disconnected from the outside world. They are not allowed to leave, and anyone who tries is immediately punished. Fiona starts to feel like she is being watched, and she can sense that something sinister is going on. One night, Fiona is caught trying to leave Eden. She is brought before the leaders of the community and interrogated. They tell her that she is not the first person to try to leave, and that everyone who has tried has always come back. They offer her a choice: she can either stay in Eden and be happy, or she can leave and be destroyed. Fiona decides to leave, and she is immediately attacked by the people of Eden. She is able to fight them off and escape, but she is gravely injured. She is found by a group of people from the outside world who take her back to their village. END: Fiona spends the rest of her life fighting against the utopians, who are led by a woman called Eve. She knows that they are using people like her, people with special abilities, to create a new race of genetically-modified superhumans. She is determined to stop them, even if it means sacrificing her own life.
