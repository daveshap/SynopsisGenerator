==========

Nicolas is a young, flawed medical student in Brazil who aspires to be a great doctor like his father. However, when the local cartel threatens his family, he is forced to drop out of school and join their ranks in order to protect them. He quickly realizes that the life of a cartel enforcer is not for him, but he is trapped by his own sense of duty. One day, the cartel sends Nicolas and his team to escort a shipment of drugs through the Brazilian rainforest. To their surprise, they are ambushed by a rival gang. In the ensuing firefight, Nicolas is gravely injured and left for dead. Miraculously, he is found and rescued by a group of resistance fighters who are fighting against the cartel's tyrannical rule. Nicolas joins their cause, using his medical skills to help the injured and using his inside knowledge of the cartel to help the resistance take them down. However, the closer Nicolas gets to the resistance's leader, the more he realizes that she is also flawed. She is ruthless in her fight against the cartel and is willing to sacrifice anything, even lives, to achieve her goals. Nicolas must make a choice: save the resistance or save his own soul.

He quickly realizes that the life of a resistance fighter is not for him, but he is trapped by his sense of duty. However, when the resistance's leader orders a massacre of innocent civilians, Nicolas has had enough. He betrays the resistance and rejoins the cartel in order to stop the leader and save the people. The leader is enraged by Nicolas's betrayal and vows to kill him. The two engage in a deadly duel, but in the end, the leader is victorious. Nicolas is left seriously injured and is once again left for dead. END: Nicolas is found and rescued by the resistance fighters he once betrayed. They take him in and nurse him back to health. Nicolas is deeply remorseful for his actions and wants to make things right. He joins the resistance once again and helps them in their fight against the leader. However, the leader is a formidable opponent and the resistance is outnumbered and outgunned. In the end, the resistance is defeated and the leader is killed. Nicolas is the only survivor. He is left traumatized by the violence and bloodshed, but he is also free.
