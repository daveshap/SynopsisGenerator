It is the early 20th century in Egypt. The country is in a period of great change and upheaval, as it is transitioning from being a British colony to an independent nation. This time of political and social transition is also a time of great spiritual awakening, as people from all walks of life are beginning to explore the ancient practices of meditation and psychic development. One of the most popular psychic development teachers is a woman named Madame Serpent, who leads a group called the Cult of Isis. The Cult of Isis is based on the ancient Egyptian belief that the goddess Isis is the ultimate source of all knowledge and power. Madame Serpent and her followers believe that by meditating on Isis and studying her mythology, they will be able to tap into her power and wisdom. The Cult of Isis is growing rapidly, attracting new members from all over Egypt. One of these new members is a young woman named Fatima. Fatima is a very gifted psychic, and she quickly becomes one of Madame Serpent's most promising students. Under Madame Serpent's guidance, Fatima begins to explore her psychic abilities. She soon discovers that she has the ability to astral travel, and she begins to use this ability to explore the spiritual realm. She also begins to develop her ability to channel Isis, and she starts to receive messages from the goddess. Madame Serpent is very impressed with Fatima's progress, and she starts to groom her to be her successor. Fatima is reluctant to take on such a responsibility, but she feels drawn to Madame Serpent and the Cult of Isis. As Fatima becomes more involved with the Cult of Isis, she starts to distance herself from her old life. She breaks off contact with her family and friends, and she starts to devote all her time to the cult. Madame Serpent is true to her word, and she starts to teach Fatima everything she knows about psychic development and spirit cultivation. Fatima is a quick learner, and she soon becomes one of the most powerful members of the cult. However, not everyone is happy with Fatima's success. There are some members of the cult who are jealous of her power and authority, and they start to plot against her. One night, Fatima is visited by Isis in a dream. Isis tells Fatima that she is in danger, and she must leave the Cult of Isis immediately. Fatima tries to warn Madame Serpent about the plot against her, but Madame Serpent doesn't believe her. Fatima knows that she has to leave the cult, but she's not sure how she'll be able to do it. Late one night, Fatima finally makes her escape. She's pursued by a group of cult members, but she's able to lose them by astral travelling to the spiritual realm. Once she's free from the cult, Fatima starts to build a new life for herself. She reconnects with her family and friends, and she starts to help others who have been harmed by spirit cults. Fatima continues to work as a psychic development teacher and counselor, helping people to connect with their spiritual guides and develop their psychic abilities. She also continues to act as a conduit for Isis, helping to spread the goddess's messages of love, hope, and healing to the world.
