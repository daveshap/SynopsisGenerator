Write a brief one sentence summary of this story:


The narrator wakes up disoriented in a cold and dark room. They are alone and have no idea where they are or how they got there. They try to stand, but their legs give out from under them and they collapse to the floor. They see a faint light coming from under a door and drag themselves towards it, but the door is locked. They pound on the door and yell for help, but no one comes. The narrator's mind starts to race and they start to panic. They think about all the horror movies they've seen where the protagonist is trapped in a room with no way out. They wonder if this is what their final moments will be like. Suddenly, the door swings open and the narrator is blinded by a bright light. When their vision clears, they see that they are in a hospital room. A doctor and a nurse are standing over them, looking concerned. The doctor tells the narrator that they were found unconscious in an abandoned building. The police are investigating, but so far there are no leads on who the narrator is or how they got there. The nurse helps the narrator to a bed and asks if they remember anything. The only thing the narrator can recall is a feeling of sheer terror. The nurse assures the narrator that they are safe now and leaves the room. The doctor tells the narrator that they are lucky to be alive. He says that it's been weeks since the abandoned building was vacated and that the police have been combing the area for any clues. The doctor says that the narrator is the only person to have been found alive in the building. The narrator asks the doctor how they got there. The doctor says that they were probably brought there by someone who wanted to hurt them. The police are doing everything they can to find the person responsible. The doctor runs some tests on the narrator and tells them that they are physically healthy, but that they are suffering from severe psychological trauma. The doctor says that the narrator will need to be hospitalized for some time so that they can receive treatment. The narrator is taken to a psychiatric hospital where they are put on a strict regimen of medication and therapy. The doctors and nurses try to help the narrator to remember what happened to them, but their memories are still foggy. Over time, the narrator starts to recover and their memories start to come back. They remember being kidnapped by a man who kept them locked in a room. The man would come in periodically and torture the narrator, both physically and psychologically. The man never told the narrator why he was doing this, but the narrator assumes that it was because the man enjoyed seeing them suffer. The man eventually got bored of torturing the narrator and left them to die in the abandoned building. The narrator was found by the police and taken to the hospital where they eventually recovered. The police were never able to find the man who kidnapped the narrator and he was never brought to justice. The narrator is left with permanent scars, both physical and psychological. The narrator is now an old woman. She still has nightmares about her ordeal, but she has learned to deal with them. She is grateful to be alive and has made it her mission to help others who have been through similar experiences. The narrator has dedicated her life to working with victims of violence and helping them to heal. She has forgiven her attacker and has found peace in knowing that he will eventually face justice, even if it is not in this lifetime.
