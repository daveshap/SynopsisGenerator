==========

46-year-old failed novelist Wang Wei is on a trip to China with his wife Nina and their teenage daughter Lily. While in Beijing, they take a tour of the Great Wall.

Astorm suddenly rolls in and the family is forced to seek shelter in one of the wall's watchtowers. They're soon joined by two other tourists, a young couple from New Zealand. As the storm rages, Wang Wei falls into a deep sleep. He dreams that he is back in his hometown of Lanzhou in the first century BCE. He is walking along the Yellow River when he comes across a group of laborers who are quarrying stone. He strike up a conversation with one of the workers, a Chinese man named Jing Ke. Jing Ke tells Wang Wei that he is helping to build a wall to keep the river from flooding. Wang Wei is fascinated by Jing Ke's story and asks him to tell more. Jing Ke obliged, and over the course of the next few days, he tells Wang Wei about his life and the life of his people. He describes the hardships they endure, the back-breaking labor, and the constant fear of being swept away by the river. But he also talks about the beauty of the land, the kindness of the people, and the sense of community that exists among the workers. As Wang Wei listens to Jing Ke's stories, he begins to feel a deep connection to the man and to his people. He starts to see the world through their eyes and to understand their struggles. He also starts to feel a sense of hope for the future. When Wang Wei wakes up, he realizes that the storm has passed. He and his family are safe. But he can't shake the feeling that he has been changed by his experience. MIDDLE: Wang Wei starts to research the first century BCE and becomes increasingly fascinated by the period. He reads everything he can find about the Han Dynasty and the people who lived during that time. He also starts to write a novel set in that time period. As he writes, Wang Wei begins to identify more and more with Jing Ke and the other workers. He starts to see their struggles as his own and to feel a sense of responsibility for their well-being. He also starts to feel a deep love for Nina and Lily, and he realizes that he wants to protect them from the harsh realities of the world. One night, Lily is up late working on a school project. She stumbles upon one of Wang Wei's journal entries in which he describes his feelings for her. She is touched by his words and feels a deep connection to him. Later, Wang Wei has a dream in which he is back in the first century BCE. He is on the banks of the Yellow River with Jing Ke. They are about to start quarrying stone when Jing Ke's young son runs up to them. Jing Ke tells Wang Wei that he must leave to take care of his son and asks Wang Wei to take his place. Wang Wei agrees, and he and the other workers begin to quarry stone. Suddenly, the river starts to rise and the workers are in danger of being swept away. Wang Wei uses his knowledge of the future to help them escape. He tells them to build a wall to keep the river from flooding. The workers follow Wang Wei's instructions and are able to build the wall in time. They are saved, but Jing Ke's son is killed in the process. Jing Ke is devastated, but Wang Wei reassured him that his son is in a better place. When Wang Wei wakes up, he is filled with a sense of purpose.

Meanwhile, the workers continue to quarry stone and build the wall. The river continues to rise, but the wall holds strong. Wang Wei is there to help them every step of the way, and he starts to feel like part of their community. One day, Jing Ke comes to Wang Wei with some bad news.
