In the stone age, a group of people are living in a small village in Asia. One day, a young woman named Saya is out gathering firewood when she notices a strange man lurking in the bushes. She tries to run away, but the man catches her and brutally kills her. The rest of the villagers are alerted by Saya's screams, and they come running. They find her dead body and are horrified. They know that they can't just leave her body there for the animals to feast on, so they decide to cremATE her. The chief of the village, Ota, decrees that from now on, everyone must travel in pairs when they leave the village. This will help to protect them from the killer. Everyone is on edge, and they all worry that the killer will strike again. Sure enough, a few days later, another woman from the village is killed while she is out gathering food. The villagers are terrified, and they start to suspect that the killer might be one of their own. They decide to hold a trial to try to figure out who the killer is. Ota's daughter, Ayame, is the one who suggests using fire as a way to smoke out the killer. Everyone in the village gathers around the fire, and one by one, they all put their hands into the flames. Whoever is the killer will be unable to bear the pain of the flames and will reveal themselves. At first, everyone seems to be able to handle the pain, but then one of the men, Toki, starts to scream. He admits to being the killer and begs for forgiveness. The villagers are shocked and horrified, but they knows that they can't let him go. They drag Toki to the edge of the village and leave him there for the animals to finish off. The villagers think that Toki was the only killer, but soon they realize that there are more killers in their midst. The villagers start being killed off one by one, and it's clear that there is more than one killer. The villagers are terrified and don't know who to trust. They start to suspect that everyone might be a killer, and they start turning on each other. The situation spirals out of control, and eventually, only a few villagers are left alive. They manage to finally track down and kill all of the killers, but their village is left in ruins. There are no winners in this story, only survivors.
