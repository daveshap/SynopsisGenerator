France, first century. In a small village, a young girl named Sybille is born. She is the daughter of a Priest and a visiting Roman dignitary. As a child, she is fascinated by the stories of the Bible and the miracles of Jesus. When she is old enough, her father begins to teach her about the Bible and the day-to-day workings of the church. During her teenage years, Sybille begins to question the church and its teachings. She wonders why there is so much suffering in the world and why the church seems more interested in power than helping people. She is also disturbed by the growing rift between the Romans and the Jews. Eventually, Sybille's questions lead her to a new understanding of the Bible and the teachings of Jesus. She comes to believe that the suffering in the world is a result of people's sinfulness, and that the church exists to help people find forgiveness and salvation. With her new understanding, Sybille decides to dedicate her life to the church. She becomes a teacher and preacher, and travels throughout France sharing her faith with others. ENDING: Sybille's work with the church earns her the respect of both the Romans and the Jews. She is even invited to speak at the Emperor's palace.

She helps people to understand that suffering is a result of sin, but that forgiveness and salvation are possible through faith.
