BEGINNING:

==========

It's another cold, dark night in Scandinavia and Emma is huddled up in her bed, trying to fall asleep. But sleep won't come. She's too anxious, too on edge. She's beenhaving nightmares lately, graphic, disturbing dreams that leave her feeling shaken and paranoid during the day. She's tried everything to shake them - counting sheep, drinking chamomile tea, even reading before bed instead of watching TV - but nothing works. Maybe it's the stress of her job, or the fact that she's single and lonely. Or maybe, just maybe, it's because she knows deep down that her nightmares are actually based in reality. After another sleepless night, Emma decides to take a walk. She needs to clear her head, get some fresh air. But as she walks through the deserted streets, she can't help but feel like she's being watched. And when she finally makes it back to her apartment, she finds the door slightly ajar... MIDDLE: Emma pushes the door open cautiously, her heart pounding in her chest. She half expects to find a burglar inside, but the apartment is empty. Nothing seems to be missing, but Emma can't shake the feeling that something is definitely off. She does a quick sweep of the rooms, checking closets and under the bed, but there's no sign of an intruder. It's almost like they were never there. Emma starts to wonder if she's just being paranoid. Maybe her insomnia isstarting to take its toll. But then she sees it: a single red rose on her kitchen table. There's no card, no note, nothing. But Emma knows exactly who left it there. And she knows that her nightmares are far from over. END: Emma is being stalked. Someone is watching her every move, following her every step. They know her routines, her schedule. They know where she lives, where she works. They even know her deepest, darkest secrets. Emma is terrified, and she has no idea who to turn to. The police are sceptical, her friends and family think she's just being paranoid. But the person who is stalking her is very real, and very dangerous. Emma is in a race against time to figure out who is stalking her and why. But as she gets closer and closer to the truth, she realizes that her stalker knows her far better than she knows herself. And they're not going to stop until they get what they want. Scandinavia has never been so sinister.
