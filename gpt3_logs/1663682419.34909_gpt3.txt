One day, a group of hunters goes out into the wilderness in search of food. They are successful in their quest, but as they are making their way back to their village, they are attacked by a group of wild animals.

His friends carry him back to the village, but it is clear that he will not survive.

The pyramids are an awe-inspiring sight, and Hyrkanus is filled with wonder at the engineering feats that they represent.
