BEGINNING:

==========

In an alternative timeline, Egypt is a prosperous and powerful empire. However, all is not well within the royal palace. The Pharaoh, Akhenaten, is a cruel and tyrannical ruler, who has instituted a reign of terror. His wife, Nefertiti, is a beautiful and fearless woman who is tired of living in fear. She yearns for freedom and is determined to find a way to overthrow her husband. One night, Nefertiti comes up with a plan. She will seduce one of Akhenaten's advisors, Horemheb, and convince him to help her overthrow the Pharaoh. Nefertiti knows that Horemheb is attracted to her, and she is confident that she can seduce him. Nefertiti's plan works perfectly. Horemheb is completely infatuated with her, and he agrees to help her. Together, they begin to plot Akhenaten's downfall. MIDDLE: As the plot progresses, Nefertiti and Horemheb grow closer and their relationship becomes sexual. Akhenaten becomes increasingly paranoid, and his grip on power begins to slips. Nefertiti and Horemheb capitalized on this, and they succeed in overthrowing him. After Akhenaten is deposed, Nefertiti becomes the new Pharaoh. She is a just and fair ruler, and the people of Egypt love her. However, Horemheb is not content to simply be her advisor. He wants to be her husband, and he will stop at nothing to achieve his goal. Nefertiti knows that Horemheb is power-hungry and dangerous, but she can't help but be drawn to him. Eventually, she gives in to his demands, and they are married. END: Nefertiti and Horemheb's marriage is a tumultuous one, but they remain together. Horemheb continues to be ambitious, and he slowly starts to accumulate more power. Nefertiti realizes that he is becoming just like Akhenaten, and she is fearful for the future. One night, Nefertiti confronts Horemheb about his ambitions. They argue, and Horemheb ends up strangling her to death. Afterwards, he regrets what he has done, but it is too late. He has become a murderer, and there is no going back.
