In her dreams, she sees a massive ship sailing through the stars. On the ship is a great and powerful ruler who is wearing a crown of thorns. Suzanne is told that this ruler is destined to save France from its enemies and lead the people to glory once again. Suzanne shares her dreams with her friend, Jean-Luc, who is a gifted engineer.
