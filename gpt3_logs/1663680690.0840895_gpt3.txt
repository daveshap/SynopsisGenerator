August, 1944. The Allies are pushing the Germans back towards the Fatherland, and victory seems within reach. But the Nazis are fighting tooth and nail, and they have one last, desperate plan. They're going to unleash a new weapon, a weapon so terrible that it will turn the tide of the war. The weapon is a virus, a virus that turns people into zombies. The Nazis have been working on it for years, perfecting it in secret laboratories. And now, they're ready to unleash it on the world. The virus is released in the North Atlantic, onboard a German submarine. The submarine is sunk by the Allies, but not before the virus has been released into the water. The virus spreads quickly, infecting people all over the world. It turns them into mindless zombies, slaves to the Nazi cause. The Nazis use the zombies to further their campaign of terror and oppression. The virus is spreading unchecked, and it seems like there's no hope.
