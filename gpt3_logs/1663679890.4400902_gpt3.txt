BEGINNING:

==========

uproariously funny and highly intelligent squirrel, Aloysius, lives in the forests of France during the Late Middle Ages and dearly loves acorns. One day, while storing his acorns for winter, Aloysius comes across a golden acorn and decides to keep it safe. That same day, Aloysius meets a beautiful and friendly deer, Isabella, and they become friends. Isabella tells Aloysius of a group of vicious hunters who have been terrorizing the forest and killing animals for sport. Aloysius comes up with a plan to stop the hunters and save the forest. He enlists the help of his animal friends, and they hatch a plan to use their individual talents to create a series of traps for the hunters. The first trap involves leading the hunters into a deep pit. The second trap involves a rock slide that crushes the hunters. And the third trap is a cage made of sharpened tree branches that impales the hunters. After the hunters are stopped, Aloysius and Isabella declare their love for each other and live happily ever after in the forest. THE END.
