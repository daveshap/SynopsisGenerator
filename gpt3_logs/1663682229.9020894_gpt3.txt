Write a brief one sentence summary of this story:


The story begins in India during the Bronze Age. A group ofBandits robs a caravan and kills everyone except for one man, who they take prisoner. The man, who is wounded, is taken to their leader, a mysterious figure known only as the Riddler. The Riddler interrogated the man, but he refused to talk. So, the Riddler had one of his men killed in front of him in a gruesome way. The man still refused to talk, so the Riddler had him killed as well. With the man dead, the Riddler revealed that he wanted to know the location of a treasure that the man had been guarding. The Riddler believed that the man had hidden the treasure before he died, and he was determined to find it. He issued a challenge to the man's daughter, who was also travelling with the caravan. He promised her that if she could solve his riddle, he would let her go. The riddle was: "I am not alive, but I grow; I don't have lungs, but I need air; I don't have a mouth, but water kills me. What am I?" The woman thought for a long time, but she couldn't figure it out. The Riddler then had her killed. The Riddler continued his trail of death and destruction, moving from village to village, asking his riddle and killing those who couldn't answer. He soon became the most feared man in all of India. No one could stop him, and no one knew how to defeat him. One day, the Riddler came to a small village and asked his riddle. But this time, a young boy was able to answer it. The boy told him that the answer was "fire." The Riddler was shocked that someone had finally been able to solve his riddle, and he was even more shocked when the boy told him that he had heard the answer from a god. The Riddler didn't believe in gods, but he was intrigued by the boy's story. He asked him where he had heard the answer from, and the boy told him that he had dreamt it. The Riddler was fascinated by this and asked the boy to tell him more about his dream. The boy told him that he had dreamt that he was in a land of eternal fire, and that he had heard a voice telling him the answer to the riddler's question. The voice had told him that the answer was "fire." The Riddler was amazed by this and asked the boy to lead him to this land of eternal fire. The boy took him to a nearby mountain, and the Riddler saw that there was a fire burning at the top of it. He was convinced that this was the place where the boy had heard the voice, and he was determined to find out more. The Riddler climbed to the top of the mountain and entered the fire. He was immediately incinerated, but as he died, he heard the voice again. The voice told him that the answer to his riddle was "life." The Riddler realized that he had been searching for the wrong thing all along, and that the true treasure was not a material thing, but the knowledge that he had gained.
