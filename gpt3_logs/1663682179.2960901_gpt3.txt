Write a brief one sentence summary of this story:


It is the second century BCE, and the world is a very different place than it is today. In this alternate history, the Roman Empire never rose to power, and the world is instead divided into a number of small city-states and squabbling kingdoms. In this context, the story follows the crew of the Lachesis, a small spaceship that is part of a much larger international fleet. The Lachesis is on a routine mission to explore a newly discovered star system when they come across something completely unexpected: an artificial structure orbiting a dead planet. As the crew begins to explore the structure, they quickly realize that it is of alien origin, and that it is unbelievably ancient. They also realize that the structure is somehow still powered, and that it is somehow still functioning. They soon discover that the structure is a portal, and that it leads to another star system. The crew decides to go through the portal, and they find themselves in a strange and dangerous place. The crew quickly discovers that they are not the only ones who have come through the portal. There are other ships from other fleets, and they are all crewed by people from a variety of cultures and eras. It quickly becomes clear that the portal is a time portal, and that it leads to a place where time has no meaning. The crew of the Lachesis soon realizes that they are in a battle for their lives, and that the only way to get back to their own time is to find the portal and close it. As the crew of the Lachesis tries to make their way back to the portal, they are constantly attacked by a variety of strange and dangerous creatures. They also have to contend with the other ships that have come through the portal. Some of these ships are friendly, but many are not, and the crew of the Lachesis soon finds themselves in the middle of a conflict that they do not fully understand. In the midst of all this, the snarky and sardonic tone of the story provides some much-needed levity. The characters often find themselves in humorous or farcical situations, and their dry wit and biting sarcasm provide some relief from the constant danger and stress. Ultimately, the crew of the Lachesis is successful in find the portal and closing it. But their victory is short-lived, as they soon realize that there are other portals that have been opened, and that other fleets have gone through them. The crew of the Lachesis knows that they must find these other portals and close them, before it is too late.
