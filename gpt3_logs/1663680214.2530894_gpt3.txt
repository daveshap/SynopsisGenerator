==========

In the year 1592, Korea is in the midst of a devastating war. The country is divided into two factions: the Joseon Dynasty, which has allied itself with Japan, and the rebel forces fighting against them. Among the rebels is a young woman named Yunhee. Yunhee is a skilled archer, and she has been fighting alongside her brother and father ever since the war began. But when her brother is killed in battle, and her father is seriously wounded, Yunhee is left to fight alone. She is eventually captured by the Joseon Dynasty and taken to their capital, Hanyang. There, she is put on trial for her crimes against the state. In the months leading up to her trial, Yunhee is held in a prison cell with a woman named Jiyoon. Jiyoon is also a rebel, and she has been convicted of similar crimes. The two women form a bond as they await their fate. In the meantime, the war continues to rage on. The Joseon Dynasty is slowly losing ground to the rebels, and Hanyang is under siege. MIDDLE: As the siege of Hanyang intensifies, food and supplies become scarce. Yunhee and Jiyoon are bothweak from hunger and malnutrition. One day, they are both brought before a military tribunal. Yunhee is given the opportunity to renounce her rebel convictions and join the Joseon Dynasty, but she refuses. She is sentenced to death. Jiyoon, on the other hand, is offered a deal: if she agrees to spy on the rebels, she will be spared. She accepts, and she is released from prison. A few days later, Yunhee is executed. Her body is displayed in public as a warning to other rebels. As the war continues, Jiyoon provides the Joseon Dynasty with information about the rebel forces. But she is haunted by her decision to betray her comrades, and she longs for revenge. END: Finally, the war comes to an end. The Joseon Dynasty is toppled, and the rebels take control of the government. Jiyoon is given a position of power within the new regime. But she is still consumed by her desire for vengeance. She eventually tracks down Yunhee's father, who is now living in poverty. She kills him, and then she commits suicide.
