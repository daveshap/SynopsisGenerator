BEGINNING:

==========

Nebet is a young priestess in Egypt who is coming of age in a time of great change. The Pharaohs are no longer as powerful as they once were, and the country is in a state of flux. Nebet is introspective and thoughtful, and she often finds herself questioning the old ways. When her best friend, Heshwi, is married off to a wealthy nobleman, Nebet is heartbroken. She had always thought that she and Heshwi would be together forever. As the years go by, Nebet continues to serve in the temple, but her heart is no longer in it. She is restless and longs for something more. She has never forgotten Heshwi, and she often wonders what her life would have been like if they had been able to stay together. One night, Nebet has a dream in which she is visited by the goddess Isis. Isis tells Nebet that she has a special destiny, and that she must go on a quest to find a lost city that is hidden in the desert. Nebet is hesitant at first, but she eventually agrees to go on the quest. As Nebet begins her journey, she is accompanied by her faithful cat, Bast. Bast is always there to keep Nebet company and to offer words of wisdom. Together, they travel across the desert, braving sandstorms and heatstroke. Finally, they reach the lost city of Osiris. In the city, Nebet meets a man named Tahar. Tahar is a historian who has been studying the lost city for many years. He is intrigued by Nebet and her story, and he agrees to help her find the answer to the riddle of the lost city. Together, Nebet and Tahar explore the ruins of the city, and they gradually piece together its history. They discover that the city was once a thriving metropolis, but it was eventually abandoned due to a curse. As they learn more about the city, they also start to develop feelings for each other. Nebet is no longer sure if she wants to leave, but she eventually realizes that she must return to her life in Egypt. She says goodbye to Tahar and returns to the temple. END: Nebet has changed after her adventure in the lost city. She is no longer content with just following the old ways. She starts to question the beliefs of her religion, and she eventually decides to leave the temple. Heshwi is still married to her nobleman, but she is not happy. She misses Nebet and often wonders what could have been. Nebet and Heshwi eventually meet again, and they reminisce about their childhood together. They both realize that they have changed and that they are no longer the same people they once were. They part ways, but they remain friends. Nebet eventually settles down with Tahar, and they live happily together in the lost city of Osiris.
