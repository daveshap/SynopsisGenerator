BEGINNING:

==========

In the distant future, humanity has colonized the stars and developed faster-than-light travel. One of the most popular forms of entertainment in this future society is concert films, which are shot in unique locations throughout the galaxies and then broadcast to a wide audience. The film that is the focus of this story is shot aboard a large space station that is in orbit around a planet. The space station is home to a variety of businesses and attractions, and it is also a popular destination for tourists. The two main characters of the film are a pair of best friends, Alex and Lia. They are both huge fans of concert films, and they have been looking forward to this particular film for months. As the film concert begins, the two friends are ecstatic. They are awed by the incredible visuals and the catchy music. However, things quickly take a turn for the worse when the space station is suddenly attacked by a group of pirates. The pirates take control of the space station and start to loot and pillage. They also take the concert film crew hostage, demanding a ransom for their safe return. Alex and Lia manage to avoid being captured by the pirates, and they quickly come up with a plan to save the hostages and stop the pirates. They race against the clock to put their plan into action, and in the end, they are successful in defeating the pirates and rescuing the hostages. The film ends with a heroic shot of Alex and Lia walking hand in hand as they are hailed as heroes by the grateful concert film crew.
