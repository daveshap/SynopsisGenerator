BEGINNING:

==========

It is the 3rd century BCE and the North Atlantic is a wild and unfamiliar place. The land is unclaimed and the people are few and far between. One of these people is an awkward young man who has recently been forced to leave his home. He is unsure of himself and lacks the social skills to make friends easily. He is surnamed the Gaul by the few people he meets. The Gaul is a loner by nature and he soon finds himself wanderings aimlessly about the land. He meets a man who tells him of a witch who lives in the forest and who is said to be able to grant any wish. The Gaul is skeptical but decides to seek out the witch anyway. He finds her deep in the forest and she tells him she can grant any wish he desires. The Gaul asks to be made into the most powerful warrior in the world. The witch obliges and transforms him into a massive, muscular man with inhuman strength. The Gaul is now a terror to behold and he quickly establishes himself as the most feared warrior in the land. He is content to live a life of violence and bloodshed. But soon the Gaul begins to tire of this lifestyle. He longs for something more. He meets a woman who tells him of a legend of a great hero who will one day come and save the people from an evil sorcerer who has enslaved them. The woman tells the Gaul that he is the hero of the legend. The Gaul is doubtful at first but he decides to go on a journey to find the sorcerer. He travels to the sorcerer's fortress and defeats him in single combat. The people are freed and the Gaul is hailed as a hero. He returns to the forest to thank the witch but she is gone. He is content now to live a life of peace and happiness with the people he has saved. END.
