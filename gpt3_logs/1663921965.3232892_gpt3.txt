BEGINNING:

==========

Sception, a young woman of mixed Scandinavian and Nigerian heritage, has just moved to Oslo, Norway to start her new life. She's eager to learn more about her Nigerian roots and to connect with other people of color in the city. However, she quickly discovers that the majority of people in Oslo are white and that she is often the only person of color in her social circles. One day, while out exploring the city, Sception comes across a small, hidden alleyway that she's never noticed before. Curious, she decides to venture down it and is immediately confronted by a strange man who tells her to "go back the way you came." Startled, Sception tries to leave the alleyway, but the man blocks her path. He then proceeds to tell her a chilling story about a missing girl who was last seen going into the alleyway... MIDDLE: Sception is horrified by the man's story and is even more disturbed when she sees a photo of the missing girl taped to a nearby wall. She knows she needs to tell someone what she's just heard, but she's also afraid of what the man might do to her if she tries to leave the alleyway. In a state of panic, Sception decides to call her friend Ingrid, a white Norwegian woman who she's been slowly getting to know. When Ingrid doesn't answer her phone, Sception phones the police instead and tells them about the man in the alleyway and the missing girl. However, before she can finish her story, the man suddenly appears behind her and grabs her phone. He then proceeds to drag Sception back into the alleyway against her will... END: Sception is terrified and does her best to fight back, but the man is too strong. He eventually overpowers her and hauls her into a small, cramped space at the back of the alleyway where he ties her up. The man then tells Sception that the missing girl's body is hidden nearby and that if she wants to live, she needs to find it. He gives her a photo of the girl and a small flashlight, and then leaves her alone in the dark. Sception is terrified and has no idea where to start looking, but she knows she needs to find the girl's body before the man comes back. She eventually comes across a small opening in the wall and crawls inside. It's incredibly tight and she can barely move, but she keeps going until she finds the girl's body... Just as she's about to call for help, the man reappears and grabs her. He tells her that she's done a good job and that he's going to let her go. However, before he does, he whispers in her ear that he'll be watching her and that she'll never be safe. Sception is relieved to be free, but she's also shaken by her ordeal. She knows the man was serious about keeping an eye on her and she doesn't know what to do. She decides to go to the police and tell them everything, but she's not sure if they'll believe her. The novel ends with Sception giving her testimony to the police and telling them everything that happened. She's scared and shaken, but she's also determined to make sure the man is brought to justice.
