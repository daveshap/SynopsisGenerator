==========

In the year 2020, swashbuckler adventurers still exist, and Australia is their playground. 21-year-old Lara Croft is the daughter of one such adventurer, and has always dreamed of following in her father's footsteps.

But when her father is killed on a expedition in the Outback, Lara is left alone in the world. DESPAIRING, she travels to Australia to bury her father and sell off his things.

In the small town of Millbrook, she meets an old man who tells her about her father's last expedition, and how he was killed by a monstrous creature. The old man also tells her about a lost city deep in the Outback, where her father was headed when he died.

Lara is sceptical at first, but decides to investigate her father's last expedition. She sets off into the Outback, following her father's trail.

In the middle of the journey, she is attacked by the very same creature that killed her father. She barely escapes with her life, and at that moment she decides to find the lost city, not just for her father, but for herself.

Ending:

Lara eventuality finds the lost city, and discovers that it is inhabited by a race of ancient people who have been living there for centuries. They welcome her with open arms, and she quickly assimilates into their community.

She also finds love in the form of a handsome young man, and the two of them live happily ever after.
