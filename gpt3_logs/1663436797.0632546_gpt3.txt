==========

Britain, in the late Bronze age. Berthold, a sullen child of ten, is outcasts among his village peers. He ekes out a living among the sheep and doing odd jobs for the villagers. One night, during a particularly brutal storm, Berthold takes shelter in a cave. There, he discovers the entrance to a hidden world.

In this hidden world, Berthold finds a community of criminals, outcasts, and misfits. They take him in and teach him their ways. Berthold quickly adopts their lifestyle and becomes a skilled thief and con artist. Over the next few years, he rises through the ranks of this underworld community, becoming one of their leaders.

MIDDLE: Berthold's criminal activities bring him to the attention of the authorities. He is arrested and put on trial. In a last-ditch effort to avoid imprisonment, Berthold makes a deal with the prosecutors. He will reveal the location of the hidden world in exchange for a lighter sentence.

 Berthold leads the authorities to the hidden world. The community is quickly captured and dispersed. Berthold is sent to prison, where he quickly realizes that he made a mistake. He longs to return to the hidden world and the life of crime.

END: Berthold is released from prison after serving a ten-year sentence. He returns to the hidden world, but it is not the same as it was before. The community has been destroyed and its members scattered. Berthold is now a lonely, bitter man, forever changed by his experience in the hidden world.
