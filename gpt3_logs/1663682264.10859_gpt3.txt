The 5th century BCE was a time of great change in the Mediterranean region. The classical period was coming to an end and there was upheaval in many cultures. In this context, our story begins with the character of Aratus. Aratus is a young man from a wealthy family who has been sheltered all his life. He has always been different from other people and has always had a brooding, introspective personality. When his father dies, Aratus is thrust into the role of head of the family. He must now face the outside world and learn to be a leader. One of the first challenges Aratus must deal with is an arranged marriage. His bride-to-be is a beautiful but cold-hearted woman named Cleopatra. Aratus is not in love with Cleopatra, but he knows that it is his duty to marry her. The wedding goes forward, but on the night of the consummation, Aratus is horrified to discover that Cleopatra is a serpent woman! She hisses and leaves him cold. Aratus tries to forget about this incident and focus on his responsibilities, but he is constantly haunted by thoughts of Cleopatra. He becomes obsessed with the idea that she is going to kill him. Finally, he can stand it no longer and he decides to divorce her. This sets off a chain of events that will have far-reaching consequences. Aratus' decision to divorce Cleopatra sets off a political firestorm. The other families in the ruling class are scandalized and they begin to plot against him. Meanwhile, Aratus himself is going through a metamorphosis. He starts to have strange dreams in which he turns into a serpent. He also becomes more and more aware of the reptilian nature of the people around him. He starts to see through their false smiles and their cold, calculatating eyes. As the political situation in the city deteriorates, Aratus becomes convinced that Cleopatra is at the root of all the troubles. He decides to take action and he leads a group of followers in an assault on her palace. Cleopatra is killed, but in the process Aratus is seriously wounded. He is taken to the temple of Asclepius to be healed. During his time in the temple, Aratus has a series of visions. In these visions, he sees the rise and fall of great civilizations. He sees the rise of the serpent people and their slow but inexorable takeover of the world. He also sees the future of his own city and he knows that it is doomed. As Aratus recovers from his wounds, he comes to a decision. He knows that he must leave the city and go into exile. But before he does so, he decides to write a book. This book will be his legacy and it will warn future generations about the rise of the serpent people. Aratus goes into exile and spends the rest of his life writing his book. He never returns to his city, but he remains in contact with his followers. He continues to have visions and these inspire him to write more and more. The book he writes is a detailed account of the rise of the serpent people and their slow but inexorable takeover of the world. Aratus finishes his book just before he dies.
