==========

It is the year 2156, and France is a very different place than it is today. The country has been through a lot of changes, both good and bad, and is now a world power. The people of France are also very different. They are a lot more down to earth and have a strong sense of community. They also value their privacy and are very suspicious of outsiders. Enter the world of Armand Beauchamp, a world-renowned detective who has been called to France to solve a mystery. The case is this: a young woman, Elise Dubois, has been found murdered in her home. The big question is who did it? Middle: Armand Beauchamp is a very methodical detective, and he quickly begins to uncover clues that lead him to believe that Elise Dubois was killed by someone she knew. The more he investigates, the more he realizes that this is a very complicated case. There are a lot of people who had motive to kill her, and any one of them could be the killer. As Armand gets closer to the truth, the killer becomes more desperate and decides to start killing other people who were close to Elise. This only makes Armand more determined to catch the killer. Finally, after a long and grueling investigation, Armand is able to put all the pieces together and identify the killer. End: The killer is revealed to be Elise's husband, Pierre.

In the end, Armand is able to bring Pierre to justice and bring some closure to the case. Elise's family is also able to find some peace knowing that her killer has been caught.
