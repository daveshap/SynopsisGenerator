The setting is Africa during the Bronze age. Two main characters, a boy and a girl, are living in a small village. The girl is a member of the village's elite class, while the boy is an orphan who scavenges for food and survives on the outskirts of the village. One day, while the boy is out scavenging, he comes across a strange object that turns out to be a powerful artifact from a lost civilization. The boy takes the artifact to the girl, and the two of them begin to use its power to transform their village. Over the course of the story, the boy and girl use the artifact to gradually improve the living conditions of their village. They build new homes, create new farmland, and develop new technologies. As the village prospers, the boy and girl become closer and eventually fall in love. However, their idyllic life is eventually disrupted by invaders from a neighboring kingdom. The kingdom's army, outfitted with superior weaponry, begins to plunder the village's resources. In a desperate attempt to save their village, the boy and girl use the artifact's power to call forth a giant monster that drives the invaders away. The invaders are eventually defeated, but at a great cost. The village is left in ruins, and the boy and girl are both seriously injured. The girl is forced to use the artifact's power to heal herself, but in the process she is corrupted by its dark influence. The boy, meanwhile, is left critically ill. The girl begins to change, becoming more and more power-hungry. She starts to view herself as a goddess, and the people of the village become her worshipers. The boy, meanwhile, remains in a coma for several months. When he finally wakes up, he finds that the girl has changed completely. With the help of the villagers, the boy tries to confront the girl and stop her from using the artifact's power to destroy their home. But the girl is too strong, and she quickly overpowers him. The boy is left with no choice but to flee the village, vowing to find a way to stop the girl and save his home. The boy eventually finds a group of nomads who are willing to help him. Together, they travel back to the village and confront the girl. The nomads are able to distract the girl long enough for the boy to break the artifact, freeing himself and the villagers from her control. The girl is left powerless and alone, while the boy and the villagers rebuild their home. The story ends with the boy and the girl reconciling, and the two of them living together in the village as equals.
