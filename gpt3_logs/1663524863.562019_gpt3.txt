Rewrite the ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS into a BETTER SYNOPSIS by integrating the EDITOR FEEDBACK. Think like an expert author.


EDITOR FEEDBACK: 1. The synopsis word count is a bit long  try to condense it down and make it more concise while still retained all the important plot points. 2. The plot is rather predictable  consider adding some twists or original elements to make it more intriguing for readers. 3. The characters and world feel underdeveloped  flesh out the details more so readers can visualize and feel invested in the story.


ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS: In a time long ago, before even the first humans set foot on the shores of New Zealand, the land was inhabited by a race of magical beings. These beings were of all shapes and sizes, and had the ability to control the elements. They lived in harmony with nature, and had a deep respect for the land. One day, however, this peace was shattered. A group of beings, known as the Dark Ones, arrived from another world. They were bent on conquest, and immediately began to wage war on the magical beings. The Dark Ones were powerful and ruthless, and quickly began to gain the upper hand. The magical beings knew that they could not defeat the Dark Ones alone. So, they reached out to the humans, who had recently arrived in New Zealand. The humans were skeptical at first, but after seeing the power of the Dark Ones, they agreed to help. Together, the humans and the magical beings fought back against the Dark Ones. After a long and bloody battle, they were finally able to drive the Dark Ones back to their own world. In the aftermath of the war, the magical beings and the humans formed a strong bond. They decided to work together to protect the land, and keep the peace. Many years passed, and the land flourished. The humans and the magical beings continued to work together, and they were able to keep the Dark Ones at bay. However, one day, the Dark Ones returned. They had found a way to travel to New Zealand, and they were more powerful than ever. The Dark Ones immediately launched an assault on the humans and the magical beings. They were determined to conquer the land, and they would not rest until they had achieved their goal. The humans and the magical beings fought back with everything they had. But, they were outnumbered and outclassed. The Dark Ones seemed unstoppable. Just when all hope seemed lost, a group of humans and magical beings discovered a powerful artifact.
