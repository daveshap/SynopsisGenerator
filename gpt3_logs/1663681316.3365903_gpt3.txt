BEGINNING:

==========

In ancient times, the Middle East was a land of great mystery and danger. The people who lived there were constantly at war with one another, and the rivers were filled with monsters and other terrible creatures. In the midst of this chaos, there was a small oasis of peace and calm. This oasis was the kingdom of Bahrain, ruled by the wise and just King Solomon. Although the kingdom of Bahrain was small, it was a thriving land. The people were happy and prosperous, and the king was beloved by his subjects. However, one day, a strange and terrible creature began to terrorize the kingdom. This creature, known as the Jabberwock, was a massive dragon with burning red eyes. The Jabberwock terrified the people of Bahrain, and no one could stop it. One day, King Solomon had a dream in which he was told that the only way to stop the Jabberwock was to find a magical sword. The next day, he set out on a quest to find this sword. He traveled to many different lands, and finally, he found the sword in a dark cave. Armed with this magical weapon, he was finally able to confront the Jabberwock and defeat it. After this great victory, the people of Bahrain prospered for many years. However, the kingdom was eventually destroyed by a great earthquake. All that remains of it today are the ruins of the palace and the sword of King Solomon, which is now buried in the sand.
