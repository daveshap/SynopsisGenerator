BEGINNING:

==========

In the not too distant future, the world is a vastly different place. Asia is a booming superpower, having eclipsed both the United States and Europe in terms of economic and political power. The once-great nations of the West are now shadows of their former selves, having been bankrupted by decades of decline. In this new world order, crime is rampant and citizens are living in fear. One man, a former Interpol agent, has made it his mission to help the citizens of the world fight back against the crime and corruption that have taken over. He does this by leading a group of vigilante justice fighters known as the Butchers. The Butchers are a secret society that operates outside the law, using whatever means necessary to fight against evil. The story follows the Butchers as they take on a variety of cases, from stopping a serial killer who is targeting women in Tokyo to taking down a human trafficking ring in Seoul. The stakes are high and the stakes are personal, as the Butchers risk their lives to make the world a better place. MIDDLE: As the Butchers continue their crusade against crime, they find themselves up against some of the most powerful and ruthless criminals in the world. But they are not alone in their fight, as they are joined by a group of allies, including a former CIA operative, a Japanese samurai, and a Russian mercenary. Together, they take on the most difficult cases, taking down criminals and corrupt organizations that have evade justice for far too long. They stand up for the voiceless and the oppressed, and fight for a better world. END: In the end, the Butchers are successful in their mission, and the world is a better place for it. But their fight is never truly over, as there will always be evil in the world. They will continue to fight, and they will continue to win, because that is what heroes do.
