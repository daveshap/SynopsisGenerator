Write a brief one sentence summary of this story:


A satellite TV broadcaster hires a former professional wrestler to be their new commentator for their weekly wrestling show. The much-anticipated first show is set to take place in orbit, with the zero-gravity environment providing a unique and dangerous setting for the matches. The broadcaster hopes that the novelty of the setting will help increase ratings for the show, but they are also well aware of the potential hazards involved. As such, they take every precaution to ensure the safety of the participants and the viewers at home. The professional wrestler, who goes by the name of "The Rocket", is no stranger to danger. He was once one of the top wrestlers in the world, and is known for his death-defying stunts. He is confident that he can handle whatever the orbit throws at him. The other participants in the show are all experienced wrestlers as well, but they are not used to the weightlessness of space. The first match of the show is between "The Rocket" and a wrestler called "Gravity" who has a reputation for being one of the best ground-based wrestlers in the business. "The Rocket" is able to use his experience in zero-gravity to his advantage, and eventually defeats "Gravity" in a close match. The second match is between a wrestler called "The Crusher" and a relatively unknown wrestler called "Asteroid". "The Crusher" is a huge, muscular wrestler who is known for his brute strength. "Asteroid" is much smaller than his opponent, but he is incredibly agile and quick. He uses this to his advantage, and is able to defeat "The Crusher" in a upset. The third and final match is between "The Rocket" and "Asteroid". "The Rocket" is determined to win this match, and he comes out swinging. "Asteroid" is able to avoid his attacks and keep "The Rocket" off balance. "The Rocket" starts to get frustrated, and begins to make mistakes. "Asteroid" takes advantage of this and is able to defeat "The Rocket" in the final match. After the matches, "The Rocket" is interviewed by the broadcaster. He is visibly shaken by his loss, but he is also excited by the experience. He says that he has never felt so alive, and that he is looking forward to the next show.
