==========

It's a beautiful day in Japan. The sun is shining and the birds are singing. All is right with the world. Suddenly, there is a terrible commotion. screams fill the air and people start to run. A large group of cannibals have descended on the town, and they are looking for victims. The cannibals are ruthless, and they soon have the townspeople cornered. There seems to be no escape. MIDDLE: The townspeople are terrified, and they don't know what to do. They are outnumbered and outmatched. Then, a strange thing happens. One of the cannibals breaks away from the group and starts to help the townspeople. It turns out that this cannibal is different from the others. He's been touched by a spirit that has given him the strength to resist the dark urge to eat human flesh. The spirit-cannibal helps the townspeople to fight off the other cannibals. They eventually drive them away, but not before taking some heavy losses. The spirit-cannibal is hailed as a hero, and the townspeople rebuild their lives. But they always remember the day when the cannibals came to town. END: The townspeople live happily ever after, but the spirit-cannibal is never seen again. Some say he went back to the spirit world. Others say he wandered off into the wilderness to find other lost souls like himself. But one thing is for sure: the townspeople will never forget the day when the spirit-cannibal came to their aid and saved them from the ruthless cannibals.
