==========

The story begins with our protagonist, who we will call John, being arrested and put in prison for a crime he didn't commit. John is sent to a maximum security prison on the moon, which is a very different environment than he is used to. The prison is oppressive and the conditions are harsh. John is not the only one who is struggling to survive in this place. There are other inmates who are also fighting for their lives. MIDDLE: John quickly realizes that he needs to find a way to escape from the prison. He starts to form a plan, but he is constantly thwarted by the guards. He is also constantly being watched by the other inmates, who are eager to find a way to escape themselves. John's only hope is to find a way to get to the other side of the prison, where the exit is located. END: John finally manages to find a way to escape from the prison. He is helped by the other inmates, who are also eager to get out. They all make their way to the exit, but they are met by the guards. John is able to talk his way out of the situation and the guards let them go. The inmates are finally free and they all return to their homes.
