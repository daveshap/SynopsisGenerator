Think like a professional author. Brainstorm an extremely long complete, detailed synopsis for a novel with the following appeal terms:


GENRE: Psychological Thriller
SETTING: Scandinavia
TIME PERIOD: Early classical
STORY TYPE: Own voices: Here the protagonist and the author share a marginalized identity.
PACE: Leisurely paced: Due to descriptive language, focus on detail, or careful development of character or setting, these books unfold slowly, allowing the reader to savor the narrative.
CHARACTER: Culturally diverse: These books may feature characters from racial and ethnic minorities living in the United States, Europe, Canada, or Australia, as well as characters from non-white cultural groups living in other parts of the world.
STORY TONE: Noisy: Because of rousing, energetic pictures or text, these stories lend themselves to loud readings.
WRITING STYLE: Compelling: These powerful books draw readers irresistibly into the story.


Brainstorm an extremely long and highly detailed complete plot synopsis with beginning, middle, and end. Include character and setting names. Vividly depict the entire novel.

BEGINNING:

==========

The novel opens with our protagonist, a young woman of minority background living in Scandinavia, awakening from a nightmare. In her dream, she was being chased by an ominous figure through a dark and eerily familiar forest. She manages to escape the clutches of her pursuer, but the relief is short-lived as she soon realizes that she is now lost in the forest. She frantically searches for a way out, but the more she tries to find her way, the more lost she becomes. Eventually, she stumbles across a small cabin in the middle of the woods. Hoping to find help, she goes inside, only to be met by a strange and menacing figure. The figure tells her that she is now a prisoner in the cabin and will be subjected to a series of tests. Our heroine pleads for her release, but the figure is unyielding. What follows is a series of increasingly nightmarish tests, both physical and mental, that our protagonist must endure. With each test, she comes up against her own demons, both literal and figurative. She is pushed to her limits, but she refuse to give up. Eventually, she manages to overcome all of the challenges and winds up back at the beginning, at the edge of the forest. The novel ends with our protagonist waking up from her dream, realizing that she has finally escaped the forest and can move on with her life.
