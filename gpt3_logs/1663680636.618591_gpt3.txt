==========

Eons ago, the world was filled with magic and wonder. Humans and magical creatures lived side by side in peace and harmony. But then something went wrong. A great darkness descended upon the land, corrupting everything it touched. The humans fought back, using their own magic to try and drive the darkness away. But it was too powerful. It consumed them, Turning them into monsters. The magical creatures were forced to flee, scattering to the four corners of the world. Many were lost along the way. And so the world was plunged into an age of darkness and despair. For centuries, the humans and magical creatures battled. But there was hope. A prophecy was spoken that one day a new generation would rise up and defeat the darkness, restoring peace and harmony to the world. Now, in the land of New Zealand, that time has come. A new generation of heroes must take up the fight against the darkness. They will face danger and adversity, but they will not give up. They will save the world.
