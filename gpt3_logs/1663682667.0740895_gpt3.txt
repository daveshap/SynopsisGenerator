In the days before her departure, Serafina is visited by a mysterious stranger who tells her that she has a great destiny ahead of her and that she must be brave. The stranger also gives her a necklace with a strange symbol on it, telling her that it will protect her. On the voyage to Italy, Serafina befriends a young woman named Isabella who is also traveling to Florence to marry a Medici. The two girls bonded over their shared situation and arrive in Florence just before Isabella's wedding.

She looks out to see a group of men attacking another man in the street. She is about to call for help when she sees the symbol from her necklace on the man's chest. Suddenly, the man transforms into a large beast and tears apart his attackers. Scared and confused, Serafina runs back to her room and tells Isabella what she saw.
