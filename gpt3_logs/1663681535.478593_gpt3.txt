BEGINNING:

==========

On a typical day, high school student John Smith wakes up and gets ready for school. He tries to stay out of trouble, but other kids often tease him and he doesn't always know how to respond. Sometimes he wishes he could just disappear. As he walks to school, he notices a strange black cloud in the sky. It's getting closer and closer, and soon it envelopes the entire planet. John can't see anything, and he feels like he's suffocating. Suddenly, he's transported to a different time and place. He finds himself in a dark forest, and it's eerily quiet. He's not sure where he is or how he got there. As he tries to find his way out, he hears a noise in the distance. It sounds like someone is crying. He follows the noise and comes to a clearing where he sees a young girl sitting on the ground, crying. He approaches her and asks her what's wrong. She tells him that her name is Alice and she's lost. John offers to help her find her way home, and she takes his hand. They begin to walk through the forest, but it's getting darker and darker. Alice is getting more and more scared, and she clings to John's hand. Suddenly, they see a light in the distance. They follow it and find themselves at the edge of a cliff. The light is coming from a strange machine, and there is a man standing next to it. He tells them that his name is Mr. history and he can take them back in time to any moment they want to see. Alice is intrigued, but John is suspicious. He doesn't want to go back in time, but Mr. History says they can come back to the present whenever they want. John decides to go along with Alice and they step into the machine. MIDDLE: Mr. History sets the dials and they begin to travel back in time. They see the dinasours, the ice age, and witness ancient civilizations being born and slipping into decline. They see wars and natural disasters, and they learn about different cultures and religions. The further back they go, the moreAlice loves it. She feels like she belongs in another time. John, on the other hand, is starting to feel overwhelmed. He just wants to go home. One day, they travel back to the 19th century. Alice is fascinated by this time period, but John is starting to freak out. He wants to leave, but Alice begs him to stay just a little longer. Reluctantly, he agrees. As they walk around, they see that the world is very different. People are wearing strange clothes, and there are horse-drawn carriages on the streets. They hear a commotion and follow the noise to a crowd of people gathered around a building. Alice and John push their way to the front and see that a woman is about to be executed. The woman is begging for her life, but the executioner is unmoved. He drop the blade, and the woman is decapitated. Alice is horrified, but John is frozen in shock. Just then, the black cloud envelops them again and they find themselves back in the present. They're both shaken by what they've seen, but they can't forget the woman's face. ENDING: John and Alice try to go back and save the woman, but they can't find the right time period. They search for Mr. History, but he seems to have disappeared. They keep trying, but they can't change the past. Years go by, and John and Alice both get married and have kids. They never forget the woman they saw executed, and they often wonder what became of her. One day, John's kids find the time machine hidden in the forest. They step into it and are transported back to the 19th century. John and Alice's kids meet the woman who was executed, and they help her avoid the same fate. John and Alice are finally able to change the past and save the woman's life. They all return to the present and John and Alice are able to finish their lives knowing that they made a difference.
