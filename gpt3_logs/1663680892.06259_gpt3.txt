==========

In the 23rd century, France has become a dystopian wasteland where the strong prey on the weak. The protagonist, a young woman named Amelie, has been living in a remote cabin in the woods with her father, surviving on whatever they can hunt and scavenge. One day, while out scavenging for food, Amelie's father is killed by a group of cannibalistic bandits. Amelie narrowly escapes and flees into the woods. In order to survive, Amelie must take on the role of a hunter, tracking down and killing the bandits who killed her father. Along the way, Amelie meets a few other survivors, including a young man named Philippe. Together, they form a makeshift family and vowed to take down the cannibalistic bandits. MIDDLE: The middle of the story follows Amelie and her group as they track down and kill the bandits. The journey is long and arduous, and takes them through many dark and dangerous places. Along the way, they must contend with both the physical and mental tolls of their quest. Many members of Amelie's group are killed along the way, until only she and Philippe remain. Finally, they catch up to the bandits and kill them all, avenging Amelie's father and giving them the peace they so desperately crave. END: With the bandits gone, Amelie and Philippe settle down in a remote cabin in the woods, living off the land and finally able to start rebuild their lives. Over time, they have children and teach them how to survive in this new, harsh world. The story ends with a glimpse of hope, as Amelie and her family look to the future with determination.
