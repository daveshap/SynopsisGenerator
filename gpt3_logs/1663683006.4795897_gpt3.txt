It is the beginning of summer in Italy and archaeologists are busy excavating a Bronze Age site. One of the workers, a young woman named Lia, discovers a strange object buried in the ground. It is a small, statue of a creepy looking creature with long claws. Lia takes the statue to her supervisor, Dr. Rossi, who is unable to identify it. Dr. Rossi sends a photo of the statue to a colleague, who tells him that it is an artifact from a lost civilization. Meanwhile, a detective named Carlo is investigating the death of a young woman. The woman's body was found in a strange position and her death is mysterious. Carlo begins to suspect that she was murdered. He interviews the woman's friends and family, but no one seems to know anything about her death. As Carlo investigates the woman's death, he discovers that she was involved in a secretive group that was interested in the Bronze Age. He also finds out that she was close to Dr. Rossi. Carlo begins to suspect that Dr. Rossi knows more about the woman's death than he is letting on. As Carlo's investigation continues, he discovers that Dr. Rossi was actually looking for the Bronze Age civilization that created the statue. He believes that the civilization was destroyed by a natural disaster, but he thinks that some of the members may have survived.

FINALE: Carlo and Dr. Rossi are able to escape from their captors and they make their way back to civilisation. They go to the police and they tell them everything they know about the lost Bronze Age civilization and the people who killed it.
