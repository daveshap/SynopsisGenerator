BEGINNING:

==========

On the planet Vynglar, two friends, Dorn and Jad, are planning their holiday break. Dorn is a successful mercantile trader and Jad is his bodyguard and close friend. They are both looking forward to some time off from their respective duties. However, just before they are about to leave, they receive word that the king has been assassinated and that they are needed back at the palace immediately. MIDDLE: Dorn and Jad reluctantly return to the palace, where they find that the king's daughter, Princess Kalea, has assumed the throne. Kalea is a strong and determined woman, but she is also untested in the world of politics. She quickly learns that she will need all the help she can get if she is to keep her throne. Dorn and Jad agree to help Kalea, and they quickly find themselves up to their necks in court intrigue. They must use all their skills to navigate the dangerous waters of the royal court and protect the princess from those who would do her harm. END: ultimately, Dorn and Jad are successful in protecting the princess and helping her to keep her throne. Along the way, they have also managed to fall in love with each other. However, they keep their relationship a secret, knowing that it would be frowned upon by both their families. Eventually, they are forced to confront their feelings for each other and they decide to run away together. They leave the palace and the planet Vynglar behind, vowing to find a place where they can be together without having to hide their love.
