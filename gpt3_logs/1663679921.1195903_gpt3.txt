BEGINNING:

==========

Korean-American con artist wannabe Steve is fresh off the boat and looking to make a name for himself in the dangerous and cutthroat world of Korean organized crime. He sets his sights on the top gang in the city, the Tigers, and starts making his way up the totem pole by conning, bribing, and lying his way into their good graces. He quickly learns that the life of a gangster is not as glamorous as he thought it would be, and that he's in way over his head. The Tigers are involved in all sorts of illegal activities, from drug and human trafficking to racketeering and money laundering. They're also fighting a turf war with another gang, the Dragons. As Steve gets deeper and deeper into the Tigers' operations, he becomes more and more uncertain about whether or not he wants to continue down this dangerous path. But it's too late to turn back now, and he eventually finds himself in the middle of the dragons-tigers conflict. MIDDLE: The war between the Tigers and Dragons escalates, and innocent people are caught in the crossfire. Steve narrowly escapes being killed in a shoot-out, but he's traumatized by the violence he's seen. He starts to question whether or not he wants to continue going down this path, but he's in too deep to turn back now. The Tigers are planning a major heist, and Steve is inadvertently drawn into the planning. He comes up with a risky but ingenious plan that could make or break the Tigers' operation. But when the day of the heist comes, things go horribly wrong and Steve is forced to go on the run. END: With the Tigers and Dragons both after him, Steve has to use all of his cunning and wit to stay one step ahead. He finally realizes that the life of a gangster is not for him, and he wants out. But getting out is easier said than done, and he knows that he won't be able to do it on his own. He enlists the help of his friend, Jie, who is also a gangster. Together, they hatch a plan to fake Steve's death and start a new life somewhere else. But before they can put their plan into action, they're both betrayed and Jie is killed. Steve is now on his own and he knows that he won't be able to make it out alive. He decides to go out with a bang and takes down as many Tigers and Dragons as he can before he finally meets his end.
