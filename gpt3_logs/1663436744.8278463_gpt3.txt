==========

The film opens in present day America. However, something is not right. The country is in disarray and there is a feeling of unease in the air. We follow our main character, John, as he goes about his day. He is a regular guy, but there is something different about him. He seems to be living in a constant state of fear and paranoia.

MIDDLE: We learn that America is not the same as it once was. In this alternative timeline, the country has been taken over by a tyrannical government that controls everything. The people are living in a state of constant fear, and many have been imprisoned or killed. John is one of the few people who seems to be able to think for himself and he is determined to find out what is really going on.

END: John eventually discovers the truth about the government and the people who are really behind it. He also learns that he is not the only one who knows the truth. Together, they must fight against the government and expose the lies that have been told to the people.
