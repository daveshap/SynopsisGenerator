He has a strong, loving relationship with his queen, Guinevere, and together they have ruled Camelot with a fair and just hand. Although their life together has been happy, they both know that their time is finite and that one day they will have to face death. One fateful day, news reaches Camelot that a powerful sorcerer by the name of Merlin has been seen in the nearby village of Camelford. Arthur and Guinevere immediately set out to meet with him, and arthur is greatly surprised when he sees that the sorcerer is none other than his old friend and mentor. Merlin has come to warn Arthur of a great danger that is coming to Camelot, and he urges the king to take whatever measures necessary to protect his kingdom. Middle: Arthur takes Merlin's warnings seriously and begins to prepare Camelot for war. He strengthens the castle's defenses and stocks supplies in case of a siege. He also summons the mightiest knights of the realm to his side, including the legendary Sir Lancelot. As the days pass, the sense of foreboding in Camelot grows. Then, one evening, a massive army appears on the horizon, led by a fearsome magician who calls himself Mordred. Mordred demands that Arthur surrender Camelot to him, but the king refuses. The Battle of Camelot ensues, and it is fierce. Although Arthur and his knights put up a brave fight, they are outnumbered and outmatched by Mordred's army. Just when all hope seems lost, Merlin appears and uses his magic to turn the tide of the battle. Mordred and his army are defeated, but at a great cost. Many of Arthur's knights, including Lancelot, have been killed. After the battle, Arthur grieves for his fallen comrades. He knows that Camelot will never be the same. However, he takes comfort in the fact that his kingdom is still standing, and that he and Guinevere can continue to rule together. End: some time later, Arthur and Guinevere are approached by a stranger who says that he is Merlin. He tells them that he has been watching over them from the other side and that he is proud of all they have accomplished. He also warns them that there is another great danger coming to Camelot, and that they must be prepared. With Merlin's help, Arthur and Guinevere rallies Camelot's forces once again and ready the kingdom for war. However, this time they are prepared and they defeat their enemies easily. With the threat gone, Arthur and Guinevere can finally enjoy a peaceful life together. They know that their time is limited, but they cherish every moment they have left.
