Ned's1 crimes catch the attention of the city's gossipmongers. They whisper about his activities, stretching the truth and making him seem more sinister than he actually is. Despite being an outcast, Ned finds himself drawn to one of the gossips, a woman named Sarah. She's kind-hearted, but also has a sharp tongue. Ned falls in love with her, even though he knows she's out of his reach. MIDDLE: Ned's infatuation with Sarah leads him to make some poor choices. In an effort to impress her, he gets involved with a group of criminals planning to rob a wealthy man's house. The robbery goes wrong, and Ned is shot in the process.

Ned is heartbroken, but he knows he deserves Sarah's rejection. He decides to turn his life around and make something of himself. He starts by finding a job, and then begins attending church. He eventually meets a woman named Janet, who is willing to overlook his past and fall in love with him. END: Ned and Janet get married and have a happy life together. They eventually have children and settle down in the city. As Ned looks back on his life, he's grateful for the second chance he was given.
