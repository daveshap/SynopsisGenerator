MIDDLE: The survivors of the eruption struggle to rebuild their lives. Some find work in the city, while others move to the countryside to start new farms.

There are other, more sinister beings who have emerged from the lava. These creatures are dark and twisted, and they hunger for human flesh. The people of Pompeii must now contend with these monsters as well as the elements. They must find a way to survive in a world that is now full of death and darkness.
