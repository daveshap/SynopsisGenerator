Fatima is a skilled poet, and her work is full of snarky wit and emotionally intense expression. Her communities are constantly at war with each other, and she yearns for a way to end the conflict. One day, Fatima's village is attacked by a rival tribe. Her parents are killed, and she is taken prisoner. She is sold into slavery and taken to a different land, where she is forced to work in a harem. Fatima is miserable, but she is still determined to find a way to end the cycle of violence. One day, the harem is visited by a wealthy man from a neighboring kingdom. He is intrigued by Fatima's poetry and asks to hear more. They begin to correspond, and he eventually asks her to marry him. She agrees, and they are married. Fatima is now queen of a prosperous kingdom. She is still determined to find a way to end the violence, and she begins to work on a peace treaty between her kingdom and the rival kingdom. After years of negotiations, the treaty is finally signed. Fatima is celebrated as a hero, and the two kingdoms live in peace for many years.
