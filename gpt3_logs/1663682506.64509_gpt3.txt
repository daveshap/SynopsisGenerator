The year is 2155 and the world is a vastly different place than it is today. For starters, humans have now colonized the solar system and beyond. In fact, the first human settlement on Mars was established over a century ago and life on the red planet is thriving. The United Earth government governs all human settlements in the solar system and maintains peace and order through a highly advanced artificial intelligence program known as the AI constables. But there is one settlement that is not under the jurisdiction of the United Earth government and that is the orbital station known as Mondo. Mondo is a haven for criminals, outcasts, and miscreants of all kinds. It is a lawless place where anything goes and the strong prey on the weak. The only rule on Mondo is that there are no rules. When a talented young woman named Akoni is forced to flee her home on Earth after a tragic incident, she ends up on Mondo. There she meets a man named Jiro who takes her under his wing. Jiro is a former constable who was drummed out of the force for disobeying orders. He now runs a smuggling operation on Mondo. Akoni quickly proves herself to be a talented pilot and a valuable member of Jiro's team. But when a rival smuggling gang led by the ruthless Kano kidnapping Akoni's young sister, Akoni takes matters into her own hands. She mounts a daring rescue mission that quickly escalates into an all-out war between the two gangs. With the help of Jiro and his team, Akoni not only rescues her sister, but takes down Kano and his gang once and for all. In the process, she learns that there is more to life than following the rules. She also learns that sometimes the best way to fight injustice is to break the law. Akoni is now a respected leader in her own right and she and Jiro continue to run their successful smuggling operation on Mondo. They have become a force to be reckoned with and no one dares to cross them. The people of Mondo have finally found a leader who is strong enough to keep the peace and protect them from the outside world. But there are always new challenges to face and new enemies to fight. And Akoni and Jiro will be ready for whatever comes their way.
