He comes from a poor family and has never had the opportunity to develop his talents. He's always been a little troublemaker, but he's never been able to catch a break. Jill is the daughter of a wealthy family, but she's never been given anything that she truly wants. She's always had to live up to her family's expectations, and she's never been able to be her true self. The two meet by chance one day and quickly become friends.

However, their friendship is quickly put to the test when Jack's family is forced to move away. They say goodbye, promising to keep in touch, but their lives quickly take different paths.

He became increasingly frustrated with the hand that life had dealt him. The two friends stay in touch via email and social media, but their lives increasingly diverge.

One day, out of the blue, Jack sends Jill a proposal: he's going to build a powerful computer that can hack into any government or corporate database. He needs her help to finance it, and in return, she'll get a cut of the profits. Jill is initially hesitant, but she's curious about the project. She decides to take a chance and invest in it. The computer is a success, and Jack and Jill quickly become rich. They set up their own company and start to live the life they always dreamed of. However, as their company grows, so do the dangers. They find themselves up against ruthless competitors, and they quickly learn that they're not the only ones with access to the computer's power.
