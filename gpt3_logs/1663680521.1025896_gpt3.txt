BEGINNING:

==========

Life is hard for seventeen year old Solara. She's always been on her own, ever since she was kicked out of her home by her abusive father. She's been struggling to make ends meet, working odd jobs and doing whatever she can to get by. But when she's caught trying to pickpocket a rich nobleman, she's given a choice: go to jail or become the personal servant of Lord Blake, the most eligible bachelor in the empire. Seeing this as her only chance, Solara agrees to Blake's offer. She soon discovers that he's not the cold, heartless man she thought he was. He's actually quite kind and caring, and the two of them begin to form a deep bond. However, their relationship is strictly forbidden by law. If they're caught, they'll be sharply punished. Unable to resist their feelings for each other, Solara and Blake decide to run away together. But they're quickly caught and brought back to face the consequences of their actions. While Solara is given a light punishment, Blake is sentenced to death. Faced with the loss of the man she loves, Solara must find a way to save him. She hatches a daring plan that could free Blake â€“ but it's incredibly risky. If she's caught, she'll be executed alongside him. But Solara is willing to risk everything for the chance to be with the man she loves. ENDING: Solara's plan is successful and Blake is freed. The two of them are finally able to be together, and they live happily ever after.
