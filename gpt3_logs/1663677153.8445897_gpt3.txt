BEGINNING:

==========

meet protagonists, establish initial conflict/complication It was just another day on the moon. The sun was rising slowly over the horizon, casting a long shadow over the craters and plains. The earth was a blue-green dot in the distance, barely visible through the haze. But on this day, something was different. Something was stirring on the surface of the moon. A small figure was crawling out of one of the craters, shaking the dust off of its robes. As the figure stood up, it became clear that it was a man, though his features were strange and otherworldly. He had bright green eyes and long, silver hair that flowed down his back. He wore a flowing robe of blue and silver, embroidered with stars. The man stretched out his hand and spoke in a commanding voice. "I am Lunaris, Lord of the Moon. I have come to claim what is rightfully mine!" The earth shook and the moon began to grow larger in the sky. The man laughed maniacally as he grew taller and more powerful. MIDDLE: protagonist's plans start to come together/reveal themselves, complications and obstacles arise Lunaris was not content with simply ruling the moon. He wanted more. He wanted the earth, the sun, and the stars. To that end, he began gathering an army of moon creatures, called lunatics. These lunatics were loyal only to Lunaris and would do whatever he commanded. With his army of lunatics, Lunaris began to plot his conquest of the earth. He knew that the earth's armies would be no match for his own. But as Lunaris's plans began to come together, he began to realize that there was one person who could stop him: the mysterious Moon Maiden. The Moon Maiden was a legend among the lunatics. She was said to be a powerful witch who lived on the dark side of the moon. It was said that she could control the tides and the weather. Lunaris knew that if he could find the Moon Maiden and convince her to join his side, then his victory would be assured. But finding the Moon Maiden would not be easy. She was a master of disguise and could be anyone, anywhere. END: protagonist's plans are thwarted/s/he faces defeat Lunaris's search for the Moon Maiden led him to the dark side of the moon, where she was said to live. There, in a hidden cave, he found her. The Moon Maiden was younger than he expected, and she was very beautiful. Lunaris tried to convince the Moon Maiden to join his side, but she refused. She told him that his plans were evil and that she would never help him. Enraged, Lunaris attacked the Moon Maiden. But she was too powerful for him. She used her magic to bind him in chains and cast him out of her cave. Lunaris was defeated, but he vowed that he would one day return. The Moon Maiden knew that she had won this battle, but the war was far from over.
