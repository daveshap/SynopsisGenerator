However, Sakura was not content to simply sit back and enjoy her privileged life. She was determined to make a difference in the world, and so she set out to do just that. Sakura quickly found herself in the middle of a great conflict. Her homeland was being threatened by a rival kingdom, and Sakura knew that she had to do something to stop it. She gathered together a group of like-minded individuals and led them into battle. After a long and brutal fight, Sakura and her army were victorious.
