==========

In space, the crew of theBronze Age starship Intensifying is on a five-year mission to explore new worlds and expand the boundaries of human knowledge. But when they come across a strange planet that is home to a advanced civilization, they are forced to reevaluate everything they know.

The planet is called Klarion, and it is ruled by a wise and just king who has created a utopia for his people. But when the crew of the Intensifying arrives, they find that the Klarions are a bitâ€¦ different. They are short, with big heads and eyes, and they speak in a strange, singsong language.

The Klarions are friendly and welcoming, and they invite the crew of the Intensifying to stay as their honored guests. But as the crew begins to learn more about the Klarions, they realize that there is something not quite right about this planet. The more they learn, the more they realize that the Klarions are not the utopia they seem to be.

MIDDLE: The crew of the Intensifying starts to piece together the truth about the Klarions, and they realize that the Klarions are living in a false utopia. The Klarions are actually a race of telepathic aliens who have been using their abilities to control the minds of the crew.

The crew eventually discovers that the Klarions are planning to use their abilities to take over the Earth, and they must stop them. But as they prepare to leave, they realize that they have grown to love the Klarions, and they must choose between their mission and the Klarions.

END: The crew of the Intensifying decides to stay and help the Klarions, and they eventually succeed in stopping their plans to take over the Earth. But in the process, they lose their ship and they are stranded on the Klarion planet.

The crew of the Intensifying eventually learns to love their new home, and they find happiness in their new lives with the Klarions. But they always remember their home, and they continue to fight for the Earth, even though they are now light-years away.
