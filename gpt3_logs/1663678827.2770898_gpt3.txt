It's the 22nd century, and the world is a bleak and dark place. Australia is no different, and it's in this setting that our story begins.

The child slowly starts to realize that the world is not as it seems, and that there are sinister forces at work. The child begins to investigate this dark secret, and as they do, the pace of the story intensifies.
