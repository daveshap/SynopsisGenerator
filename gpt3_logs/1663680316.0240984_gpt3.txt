BEGINNING:

==========

In the small town of Shelbyville, in the heat of summer, a young girl named Scout is playing with her best friend, a boy named Jem. As they romp around the neighborhood, they stumble upon a man sitting on a porch, whittling a piece of wood. They strike up a conversation with the man, who introduces himself as Arthur "Boo" Radley. He tells them stories of his life growing up in Africa, and the two children are captivated by his tales. Jem and Scout are excited to have made a new friend, but their father, Atticus Finch, warns them to stay away from Boo. Atticus is a lawyer, and he is currently defending a black man accused of a crime he did not commit. Because of this, the town is dangerous and filled with prejudice. One night, Jem and Scout are awakened by a noise outside. They peek through the window to see a man walking around their house. It is Boo Radley! Jem is terrified, but Scout is fascinated. She runs outside to talk to him, but he disappears into the night. The next day, Atticus receives a death threat. Jem and Scout are scared, but Atticus remains calm. He tells them that they must be brave in the face of adversity. MIDDLE: The trial begins, and Atticus is successful in proving the innocence of his client. However, the town is still dangerous. Jem and Scout find themselves the targets of mean-spirited pranks and jokes. One day, as they are walking home from school, they are attacked by a mob of angry white men. They are saved by the sudden appearance of Boo Radley, who scares the men away. Jem and Scout are now convinced that Boo is a friend, and they start leaving presents for him in a tree outside his house. One day, they find their presents gone, and in their place is a gift for them: a sewing kit for Scout and a pocket watch for Jem. The town is still on edge, and one night, someone vandalismizes Atticus's office. Jem is so upset that he takes off into the woods. Scout follows him, and they find themselves at the Radley house. They are caught by Boo's father, who is angry and violent. He threatens to hurt them, but Boo intervenes and saves them. END: Boo Radley is now a hero in the eyes of Jem and Scout. They continue to leave presents for him, and they wait for him to come out of his house. One day, Atticus is attacked by a rabid dog. Boo Radley kills the dog with a knife, saving Atticus's life. Boo Radley is now a town hero, and he is invited to the Finch house for dinner. Jem and Scout are finally able to talk to him and thank him for saving their father. Boo asks to be taken home, and Jem accompanies him. As they say goodbye, Boo Radley says that he hopes to see them again soon.
