BEGINNING:

==========

God is dead, or so it seems. Across the planet, people of all religions are beginning to experience a sudden surge in religious fervor. For some, this is a feeling of finally being connected to something larger than themselves. For others, it is a feeling of being called to action. Regardless of how it manifests, the religious fervor is having a profound effect on people of all faiths. In the midst of this religious upheaval, a group of monks in a remote monastery in the mountains of Asia are grappling with their own crisis. Their leader, a man known only as the Master, has suddenly and inexplicably fallen into a deep coma. With the Master's health rapidly deteriorating, the monks must find a way to save him. Their search leads them to a hidden chamber in the monastery, where they find an ancient text that tells the story of a man who died and was resurrected by God. Could the Master be experiencing a similar fate? As the monks grapple with this possibility, the rest of the world is struggling with the implications of the religious fervor. What does it mean for the future of humanity? END: The story ends with the monks successfully resurrecting the Master. As he awakens, the Master is greeted by a vision of God. The Master then shares his vision with the monks, and they all realized that the religious fervor sweeping the planet is a sign that humanity is finally ready to embrace its divinity. The story ends on a note of hope, as the world awaits the next stage of its evolution.
