PACE: Leisurely paced: Due to descriptive language, focus on detail, or careful development of character or setting, these books unfold slowly, allowing the reader to savor the narrative.

STORY TONE: Noisy: Because of rousing, energetic pictures or text, these stories lend themselves to loud readings.

BEGINNING:

==========

It's dark, cold, and late at night in Scandinavia and our protagonist, a young woman of color, is walking alone. She's tired, she's been walking for hours, and she's completely lost. She's feeling panicked and her heart is racing. Suddenly, she hears a noise behind her and turns around to see a large, furry creature looming over her. She screams and runs away, but the creature is faster and catches up to her. It grabs her with its sharp claws and sinks its teeth into her flesh. She feels herself being pulled into the darkness... MIDDLE: She wakes up to find herself in a strange, dark place. She's disoriented and confused, and it takes her a moment to realize that she's underground. She's in some kind of cave or tunnel system, and she's not alone. There are other people down here with her, people of all different ages and races. They're all dirty and exhausted, and they all have the same look of fear in their eyes. Our protagonist begins to explore her new surroundings, trying to find some way to escape. But the more she investigates, the more she realizes that there is no way out. They're all trapped down here, with no food or water, and no hope of rescue. As the days go by, the people start to turn on each other. There's no food, so they start to eat each other. Our protagonist is horrified, but she's also desperate. She knows that she won't last much longer down here, and she has to do whatever it takes to stay alive. END: Our protagonist is one of the few people left alive, and she's completely lost hope. She's given up on trying to escape and has resigned herself to her fate. She's become a shell of a person, surviving on nothing but raw, bloody meat. She's barely human anymore, and she's completely lost her mind. One day, she hears a noise coming from one of the tunnels. She approaches cautiously, but it's not a creature this time. It's a person, a woman, and she's alive. Our protagonist is surprised and delighted, and she helps the woman to safety. The woman tells our protagonist that she's been down here for weeks, and that she's the only one who's made it out alive. Our protagonist is reinvigorated by this news. If this woman can make it out, then maybe she can too. She rededicates herself to finding a way out, and finally, after weeks of searching, she finds it. She climbs out into the sunlight and is finally free. But she's not the same person she was when she went down. She's been changed by her ordeal, and she'll never be the same again.
