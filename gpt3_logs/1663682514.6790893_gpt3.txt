This sends her into a deep depression, and she stops speaking entirely. Her father tries to get her help from a healer, but nothing seems to work. Lilliana's father decides to remarry, hoping that a new wife will be able to help Lilliana. He marries a woman named Elvira, who is much younger than him.
