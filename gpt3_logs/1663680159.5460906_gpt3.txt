==========

In the small village of Riverwood in ancient Korea, a young girl named Ji-yoon grows up. She is raised by her mother, who is a midwife, and her father, who is a farmer. Ji-yoon is a bright and adventurous child, and she loves to explore the nearby woods. One day, when she is out exploring, she finds a shiny object in a tree. When she brings it home, her father tells her that it is a mirror from the Bronze Age. Ji-yoon is fascinated by the mirror and decides that she wants to be a archaeologist when she grows up. As Ji-yoon enters her teenage years, she becomes more and more interested in boys. She also becomes more aware of the village gossip and the fact that her parents are not as well-off as some of the other families in Riverwood. When Ji-yoon is sixteen, she is courted by the son of the wealthiest family in the village. She is thrilled to be able to marry into such a prestigious family and thinks that her worries are over. However, on her wedding night, Ji-yoon's husband reveals that he is a cruel and abusive man. He beats her and rapes her, telling her that she is now his property. Ji-yoon is horrified, and she decides that she must find a way to escape from her husband. MIDDLE: Ji-yoon's opportunity comes sooner than she expects. One night, her husband goes out drinking with his friends, and he doesn't come home until the early hours of the morning. He is so drunk that he doesn't realize that Ji-yoon has taken his sword and run away. Ji-yoon doesn't know where to go, but she decides to head for the capital city. She knows that her husband will never think to look for her there. On the journey, she is helped by a kindly old woman, who gives her shelter and food. When she arrives in the city, Ji-yoon is taken in by a wealthy family, who agree to help her hide from her husband. As Ji-yoon starts to settle into her new life, she meets a man named Min-ho. He is a kind and gentle man, and he falls in love with Ji-yoon. She begins to falls for him too, but she is still haunted by her memories of her husband's abuse. One day, Ji-yoon's husband arrives in the city, looking for her. She is terrified that he will find her and kill her. However, Min-ho is able to help her escape and they flee together. END: Ji-yoon and Min-ho start a new life together in a small village. They get married and have two children. Ji-yoon has finally found happiness, but she is always aware of the fact that her husband is still out there somewhere, looking for her. One day, Ji-yoon's husband arrives in the village. He has tracked her down at last. Min-ho tries to protect her, but he is no match for her husband's sword. Ji-yoon's husband raises his sword to strike her down, but Ji-yoon grabs the Bronze Age mirror and holds it up to him. He is reflected in the mirror and sees himself for the first time. He is horrified by what he sees and drops his sword. Ji-yoon picks it up and kills him. She is finally free from her husband's abuse.
