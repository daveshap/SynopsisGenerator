However, when Lorenzo is suddenly betrothed to another girl, Caterina's world is turned upside down. She is devastated, and her heart is broken. She throws herself into her music, trying to lose herself in the beauty of the melodies. One day, while she is playing her lute in the town square, she catches the eye of a handsome stranger. He is Diego, an assassin who has come toPadova on a mission. Caterina is intrigued by him, and she can't help but be drawn to his dangerous persona.

As their relationship deepens, Caterina starts to realize that Diego is not the only one with a dark past. She starts to wonder if she can really trust him. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Caterina, Lorenzo is having second thoughts about his engagement. He can't get Caterina out of his mind, and he starts to regret his decision to marry someone else. He starts to wonder if he could ever be happy with anyone but her. As the wedding day approaches, Caterina is torn. She knows she needs to stay away from Diego, but she can't deny her feelings for him. At the same time, she can't bear the thought of Lorenzo marrying someone else. She doesn't know what to do. On the day of the wedding, Caterina makes a decision. She can't let Lorenzo marry someone else. She interrupts the ceremony and declared her love for him.

Caterina is now a wife and a mother, but she can't forget about Diego. She still has feelings for him, and she can't help but wonder what could have been. Meanwhile, Diego is getting increasingly restless. He is bored with his job and he longs for excitement. Then, one day, he gets a new assignment. He is to kill Caterina's husband, Lorenzo. Diego doesn't want to do it, but he knows he has to. Caterina is married now, and she is off-limits. He can't have her, so he might as well take away the one thing she wants most.
