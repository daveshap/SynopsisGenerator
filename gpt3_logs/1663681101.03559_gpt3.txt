Sarcastic teenager Dagon is fed up with the tyrannical rule of the ruling House of Arus and their relentless taxes. When Dagon's best friend, Edar, is drafted into the House of Arus' army, Dagon decides that enough is enough. He enlists the help of his other friends, the daring Ayra and the stoic Jor, to help him break Edar out of the army camp. The three friends quickly find themselves in over their heads, as they are pursued by the House of Arus' army and mercenaries. They are forced to flee across the country, using all their cunning and daring to stay one step ahead of their pursuers. Along the way, they discover that the House of Arus is involved in a much larger plot that threatens the entire planet. With the help of some friendly outlaws, Dagon and his friends uncover the House of Arus' plan to launch a devastating attack on the rival House of Talos, using a new weapon of mass destruction. Dagon and his friends race against time to warn the House of Talos and stop the House of Arus' plot. In the end, Dagon and his friends triumph, and the House of Arus is toppled. The planet is saved, and Dagon and his friends are hailed as heroes.
