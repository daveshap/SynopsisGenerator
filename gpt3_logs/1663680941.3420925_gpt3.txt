BEGINNING:

==========

The story begins on the planet Mons, where the protagonist, a young girl named Astrid, lives with her family. Astrid is a member of the Mons people, a marginalized group who are often discriminated against by the other residents of the planet. One day, Astrid's family is targeted by a group of xenophobic humans who want to drive the Mons people out of their homes. Astrid's parents are killed in the attack, and Astrid is left alone. Astrid is taken in by a kind human family, who help her to assimilate into human culture. Astrid grows up feeling like an outsider, never quite fitting in. When she reaches adulthood, Astrid decides to leave Mons and strike out on her own. She eventually settles on a small planet called Veloria, where she begins to build a new life for herself. However, Veloria is also home to a group of humans who don't want the Mons people there. Astrid is soon forced to confront the prejudice and bigotry she's faced her entire life. But she also finds allies in unexpected places, and together they fight for the right of the Mons people to live in peace. ENDING: Astrid's tenacious spirit and determination triumph in the end, and the Mons people are able to find a place where they can live peacefully and without fear.
