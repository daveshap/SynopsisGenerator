BEGINNING:

==========

In the year 2150, the world is a very different place. Nearly three-quarters of the planet is covered in water, and humanity has long since abandoned the land in favor of a mostly underwater existence. The 22nd century is a time of great technological advancement, and humanity has developed a number of ways to adapt to and live in their new aquatic environment. The story begins with our protagonist, a young girl named Ariel, who is living in one of the many underwater cities. Ariel is a mischievous child, and she often gets into trouble or causes minor disasters due to her curiosity or intentional disregard for the rules. One day, she gets into a particularly bad scrape and is forced to flee her home city. Ariel sets out on a journey across the vast underwater world, using her wits and ingenuity to survive in a hostile environment. Along the way, she meets a cast of colorful characters, including a handsome prince, a wise old woman, and a talking fish. As she travels, Ariel begins to ponder the big questions in life: who am I? where do I belong? and what is my place in the world? The journey is full of danger and adventure, but eventually Ariel arrives at her destination: a hidden city at the bottom of the sea. There she meets a mysterious figure who holds the answers to all of her questions. The story ends with Ariel realizing her true identity and destiny, and returning home to her underwater city.
