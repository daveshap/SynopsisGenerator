==========

It is the near future, and Japan is on the brink of an economic collapse. The government is desperately trying to find a way to save the country, but the people have lost all hope. Amidst the chaos, a young woman named Akiyama Rie looks to Bollywood films as her escape. She loves the songs, the dances, and the stories of love and loss. One day, Akiyama comes across a casting call for a new Bollywood film that is being filmed in Japan. She decides to audition, and against all odds, she gets the lead role. The film is a huge success, and Akiyama becomes a major star. However, stardom is not all it's cracked up to be. Akiyama is constantly hounded by the paparazzi and she feels like she's losing her privacy. She also finds herself being typecast as the " exotic foreigner" in roles that are not representative of her true identity. Despite all of this, Akiyama is determined to make the best of her situation. She knows that she is lucky to be able to do what she loves and she is determined to use her platform to show the world that Japan is more than just an economic superpower. MIDDLE: Akiyama's fame continues to grow, and she starts to receive offers to star in Hollywood films. She turns them all down, but she is eventually persuaded to star in a remake of a classic Bollywood film. The film is a huge success, and it catapults Akiyama to international stardom. However, the demands of her career start to take a toll on her personal life. She becomes estranged from her family and friends, and she starts to feel like a puppet controlled by her managers. One day, Akiyama has a chance encounter with a young woman named Takamura Mie. Mie is a big fan of Akiyama, and she convinces her to take part in a dance performance that she is choreographing. The performance is a hit, and it helps Akiyama to remember why she loves dance in the first place. However, just as Akiyama is starting to get her life back on track, she is dealt a devastating blow. Her film studio is bought out by a major Hollywood studio, and she is fired from her role in the upcoming film. Akiyama is heartbroken, but she refuses to give up. With the help of her friends and family, she starts her own production company. She takes on daring and controversial projects that challenge Hollywood's portrayal of Japan. She also uses her platform to speak out against discrimination and racism. END: Akiyama's films are a huge success, and she quickly becomes one of the most influential filmmakers in the world. She wins numerous awards, and she is finally able to tell the stories that she wants to tell. However, her success comes at a price. Akiyama is constantly in the public eye, and she is always under scrutiny. She is also constantly at risk of being blacklisted by the Hollywood establishment. Despite all of this, Akiyama is happy with the life she has created for herself. She knows that she has made a difference, and she is proud of the films she has made.
