A young woman named Lucia travels to Italy with her husband, Paolo. Paolo is an archaeologist who is excited to begin a new project excavating an ancient site in Rome. Lucia is less enthused, feeling homesick for her native Greece. However, she is quickly won over by the beauty of the Italian countryside and the warmth of the people. Lucia quickly becomes friends with a group of women who live in the small town near the dig site. They spend their days gossiping and chatting about the goings-on in the town. Lucia enjoys their company, but she can't help but feel like an outsider. One day, Paolo invites Lucia to come to the dig site and see what he and his team have been working on. She is amazed by the ancient artifacts and structures they have uncovered. Paolo is especially excited about a mysterious room they have found that appears to have been used for some kind of ritualistic purpose. As Paolo continues his work, Lucia grows increasingly curious about the room and what it was used for. She begins to do her own research, and she quickly discovers that the room was used for Roman blood sports. The thought of her husband and his team uncovering such a thing fills her with dread. Lucia tries to tell Paolo about her findings, but he is dismissive. He doesn't want to believe that the room was used for such a barbaric purpose. Lucia starts to worry that he is becoming obsessed with the dig site and is ignoring her. One night, Lucia has a nightmare about the room. In her dream, she sees herself covered in blood, and she wakes up screaming. Paolo tries to comfort her, but she is inconsolable. Lucia's fears are realized when Paolo and his team uncover a human skeleton in the room. The skeleton has been decapitated, and Paolo is convinced that it is the remains of a gladiator. However, Lucia knows that it is the skeleton of a young woman. She can't shake the feeling that she is somehow connected to the woman. As Paolo and his team continue to excavate the site, they find more and more evidence of the blood sports that took place there. Lucia is horrified, but Paolo is fascinated. He becomes obsessed with finding out more about the rituals that were performed. Lucia tries to distance herself from Paolo, but he is increasingly distant and preoccupied. One night, she finds him in the room staring at the skeleton. She demands to know what he is doing, and he confesses that he has been conducting rituals in an attempt to summon the spirit of the woman. Lucia is horrified and tries to leave, but Paolo stops her. He tells her that he is sorry, but he can't stop. He believes that the woman's spirit is trying to tell them something. Lucia is terrified, but she can't bring herself to leave Paolo. As Paolo becomes more and more obsessed with the room and the rituals, Lucia starts to fear for her safety. She decides to leave him and return to Greece. However,before she can leave, Paolo summons the spirit of the woman. Her ghost appears and starts to speak to them. She tells them that she was a Greek slave who was brought to Rome and forced to fight in the blood sports. She begs them to help her find peace. Lucia is overcome with grief and guilt. She tells Paolo that she can't leave him and she will help him try to find peace for the woman's spirit.
