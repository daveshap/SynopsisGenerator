These secretive businesses operate out of large, lavishly appointed houses, and offer wealthy men the opportunity to "own" a group of beautiful women who cater to their every whim and desire. While the legality of harems is hotly debated, there's no denyng their popularity. And one man who is quickly becoming the most well-known harem owner in Australia is Jaxon Wade. A brooding, dark-haired millionaire, Jaxon seems to have it all. But those who know him best can see the haunted look in his eyes, the weight of the world he carries on his shoulders. Jaxon's harem is made up of ten beautiful women, each with their own unique skills and talents. There's Katya, the former supermodel who brings grace and sophistication to the group; Amber, the street-smart hustler who is always looking for a angle; Bianca, the innocent beauty who hangs on Jaxon's every word; Cassidy, the wild child who is always up for a good time; Harper, the earnest and hard-working doctor who keeps everyone healthy; Jaelyn, the lady b Oss who always has her nose in a book; Kennedy, the ever- vigilant bodyguard who keeps Jaxon safe; Riley, the budding artist who brightens up the group with her creativity; Sienna, the savvy businesswoman who handles all of the harem's finances; and Willow, the free-spirited free who is always exploring new things. These ten women share a special bond with Jaxon, one that goes far beyond the physical. They know his dark secrets, the demons that haunt him, and they are there for him no matter what. But when a new woman, named Lexi, comes into Jaxon's life, everything changes. A beautiful and mysterious woman with her own dark past, Lexi quickly begins to disrupt the harmony of the harem. Kennedy is immediately suspicious of her,Sienna is jealous of the attention she's receiving, and Amber starts to plot ways to take her down. As Lexi's presence stirs up trouble within the harem, Jaxon starts to question his feelings for her. Is she a danger to the women he cares for? Or could she be the one person who can help him confront his demons and finally find peace? Only time will tell.
